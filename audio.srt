00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Hace varios últimos años tenemos

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
en muchos años.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
También en los próximos años,

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,080
vemos a la visión de los potenciales de crecimiento

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,080
en varios sectores,

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
particularmente en los sectores de consumidores

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,080
o el sector FMCG,

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
incluyendo las industrias de producción de comida

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,080
y beverage.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,080
En realidad, vemos el potencial de crecimiento

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,080
más grande para nuestras soluciones de encodimiento

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,080
y marcando de una perspectiva global.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Con esto en mente,

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
el mercado de encodimiento y marcando

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
es de la importancia estratégica más alta

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
para el livrador

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
y estamos enfocando todos nuestros esfuerzos

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
en seguir expandiendo la posición del livrador

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,080
y las fuerzas en este área.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
En este contexto,

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
los investimientos significativos

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
han sido realizados en el pasado

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,080
y van a seguir realizando en los próximos años.

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Esto envuelve los investimientos

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,080
en nuestra presencia global.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Mientras tenemos una subsidiaría en los Estados Unidos since 1974,

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
hemos establecido un centro de competencia

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
en China en 2022.

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
En paralelo,

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,080
hemos expandido nuestra red mundial

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
de compañías de negociación.

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Estos grandes pasos fueron acompañados

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,080
por más investimientos en salas y marketing.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Estamos seguros de que solo podemos ser

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
succesivos en nuestra industria

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
si entendemos a nuestros clientes

42
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
en las diferentes aplicaciones mejor

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
que a nadie más.

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Solo podemos darles a nuestros clientes

46
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
con el beneficio más alto posible.

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Para hacer esto,

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
es el elemento que vemos

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,080
en las aplicaciones específicas

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
y en los desafíos en detalle.

51
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
En términos de una solución comprensiva

52
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
para el producto, coden y marcando,

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,080
esto también significa

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
que podemos ofer

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
alta calidad de ingres

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,080
para una gran cantidad de aplicaciones.

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Y estamos succesivos en hacer esto

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
muy suficientemente.

59
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
En 2021,

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
hemos fortalecido

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
nuestras experiencias

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
en el área de ingeniería de ingres

63
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,080
laboratorio en el estado de equipamiento de arte.

66
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
La expansión de competencia

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
también ha llevado a la adquisición

68
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
y la integración

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
en la organización o grupo.

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Desde entonces,

72
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
hemos estado empujando

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
con el desarrollo más alto

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
de una gran variedad de tipos de ingres

75
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
especialmente para las aplicaciones desafíos.

76
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Porque entendemos

77
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
que solo podemos lograr

78
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
un resultado perfecto

79
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,080
cuando tecnología y ingres

80
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
trabajan perfectamente.

81
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Así que,

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
estamos bien posicionados

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080

y experiencias del mundo.

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Sin tus pasos y experiencias,

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
no pudimos lograr esto.

95
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Solo con vosotros

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
podemos dar máximo beneficio

97
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
como pueden ver,

127
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
no tendríamos ni idea

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
si nos justizamos

129
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
con los clientes,

136
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
nuestros expertos

137
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
han intensivamente

138
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
explorado

139
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
los trens significativos

140
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
que forman

141
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
el futuro

142
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
de la industria de packaging

143
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,080
y la manufacturación de los productos.

144
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Como nos progresamos

145
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
durante el XXI.

146
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Centro,

147
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
estamos creciendo

148
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
un demando más

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
para las soluciones

150
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
de la packaging.

151
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
El riesgo de automación

152
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
y digitalización

153
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
y procesos de producción.

154
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Y el impacto

155
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
de las escuelas laborales

156
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
en nuestras industrias.

157
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Los manufacturadores

158
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
ahora investen

159
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
en materiales innovativos

160
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
y están enfocando

161
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
en reducir

162
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
sus colegas

163
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
para los precios

164
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
para los demandos

165
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
evolucionados.

166
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Primero

167
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
y foremost,

168
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
el tren

169
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
contra la sustanibilidad

170
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
se ha convertido

171
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,080
en un aspecto indispensable.

172
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Consumores

173
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
y empresas

174
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
alike

175
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
están empujando

176
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
para materiales ecofriendos,

177
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
packaging

178
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
recyclable

179
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
y la reducción en el peso.

180
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Este riesgo

181
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
se ha convertido

182
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
no solo

183
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
en conservencias mentales

184
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
pero también

185
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
por las presiones

186
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
regulatorias

187
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
y el avance

188
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
de los impactos

189
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
de nuestras acciones

190
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
en el planeta.

191
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Más sobre,

192
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
automación

193
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
y digitalización

194
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
están revolucionando

195
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
la landscapes de producción,

196
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
operaciones

197
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
y el avance de recursos

198
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
optimizados.

199
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080

202
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
y las cosas internetas

203
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
están enviando

204
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
a las empresas

205
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
para monitorar

206
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
y controlar

207
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
sus procesos

208
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
con una presión

209
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
imprescindible

210
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
y

211
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
creer

212
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
la eficiencia

213
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
y reducir

214
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
los costos de producción.

215
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Estas tecnologías

216
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
también se mitigan

217
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
los efectos

218
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
de la escuelta laboral

219
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
de automación

220
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
de tareas complexas

221
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
y traer

222
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
nuevos trabajadores

223
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
a un precio más rápido.

224
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
La escuelta laboral

225
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
de la escuelta

226
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
se ha convertido

227
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
en un issue

228
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
crítico

229
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
en el packaging

230
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
y en los sectores de manufactura

231
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
con un impacto

232
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
significativo

233
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
en ambos

234
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
cruces

235
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
y innovaciones.

236
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Estas empresas

237
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
están creviendo

238
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
con una fuerza de trabajo

239
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
y un poco

240
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
de talento

241
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
entrando en la industria.

242
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Esta escuelta

243
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
se ha accesorizado

244
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
por el precio rápido

245
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
de los avances tecnológicos

246
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
requeriendo

247
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
trabajadores

248
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
para procesar

249
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
una escuelta laboral

250
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
que incluye

251
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
tanto

252
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
la creación tradicional

253
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
y

254
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
la proficiencia digital.

255
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
La escuelta laboral

256
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
se ha convertido

257
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
en esta fuerza

258
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
y no solo en el que

259
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
sus clientes

260
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
se adaptan

261
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
y rechazan

262
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
esta escuelta laboral

263
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
pero también contribúan

264
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
a un futuro más

265
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
sustaino

266
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
y equitable

267
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
para todo el futuro.

268
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Como siempre

269
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
hemos estado prensas

270
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
en la escuelta laboral

271
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,580
explorando nuevas

272
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
formas de hacer

273
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,080
coden

274
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
y marcar

275
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
más simple,

276
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
más flexibles

277
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
y más eficientes.

278
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,080
Y durante este tiempo

279
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
hemos nunca perdido

280
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
la escuelta laboral

281
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
más valiente

282
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
de la escuelta laboral.

283
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
En otros casos

284
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
hemos estado

285
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
procurando

286
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
soluciones

287
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
para encontrar

288
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
los desafíos

289
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
del futuro.

290
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
¡Inteligencia!

291
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
High expectations

292
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,080
lead to extraordinary solutions.

293
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Solutions that follow a vision

294
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
not a path.

295
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Solutions

296
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
that are smarter,

297
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
better,

298
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
more intelligent.

299
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Our aspiration

300
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
is to provide

301
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
best possible

302
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
customer solutions.

303
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Simplify operation,

304
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
ensuring quality,

305
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
secure efficiency.

306
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Every lightninger is designed

307
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
with this aspiration in mind.

308
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Intelligence.

309
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
That's the vision

310
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
for which we are pioneers.

311
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
This is precisely why we focus

312
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
our research and development

313
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
activities on intelligence early on.

314
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
We were the first in our industry

315
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
to do so,

316
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
to further expand

317
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
our technological leadership.

318
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,080
We invented intelligent technology

319
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
and have succeeded

320
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
in developing it

321
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
into cutting edge products

322
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
that really make a difference.

323
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
For many years we have been generating

324
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
significant customer benefit

325
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
thanks to intelligent technology.

326
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Not for the sake of technology,

327
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
but technology that delivers

328
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
the right solution

329
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
when you need them.

330
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Technology that makes coding

331
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
and marking easier

332
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
and ensures real efficiency

333
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
and productivity,

334
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
which is what customers

335
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
demand and expect

336
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
for their day-to-day operations.

337
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

338
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
once again,

339
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
the time has come for us

340
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
to take another pioneering step.

341
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
We have listened to our customers

342
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
very closely.

343
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
We have analyzed and understood

344
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
what drives them.

345
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
We have visited our customers

346
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
and tuned into their needs.

347
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
We have recognized their challenges.

348
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,080
We have also conducted extensive research

349
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
and parallel to all this,

350
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
we searched for new technologies

351
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
and sent out our engineers

352
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
and applicant consultants

353
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
on a clear mission

354
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,080
to set an all new standard.

355
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
We questioned basically everything

356
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
because if you really want

357
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
to set a new benchmark,

358
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,080
you must explore new ways of thinking,

359
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
thinking outside the box,

360
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
looking ahead,

361
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
assessing trends,

362
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,080
rejecting wrong paths with courage,

363
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
at times, taking detours.

364
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Sometimes it comes down to taking

365
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
the good things

366
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
and making them even better.

367
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
And we have recognized

368
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
that to create something

369
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
entirely new and better,

370
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,080
we need to focus even more closely

371
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
on one very specific topic

372
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
in our research and development.

373
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Intelligence.

374
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Real intelligence

375
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
that delivers more simplicity,

376
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
more efficiency

377
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
and more flexibility.

378
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
In short,

379
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
much more customer benefit

380
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
and a lot more excited

381
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
inspired customers.

382
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
This is exactly

383
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
what we have accomplished.

384
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

385
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,080
the time has finally come.

386
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Today, here and now,

387
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
you will experience

388
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,080
the most intelligent printing technology

389
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
in the world.

390
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Experience our new

391
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
live-agent coding and marking system,

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
here they are,

403
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
the new intelligence coding

404
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,080
and marking systems from the library.

405
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,080
First and only ones of their time,

406
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,080
the new Leibinger IQJet.

407
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,080
This is where tremendous application knowledge

408
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,080
meets the art of engineering.

409
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
With the IQJet from Leibinger,

410
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,080
we are introducing an all-new generation

411
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,080
of intelligent coding and marking systems.

412
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,080
And they are geared towards a single goal,

413
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
to offer our customers

414
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
the greatest possible benefit

415
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
in day-to-day use.

416
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Or to put it even more simply,

417
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
to offer more than everyone else.

418
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
And to us, this means

419
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
giving our customers the confidence

420
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
that everything is functioning smoothly

421
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
around the clock

422
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
when coding and marking their products.

423
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Providing our customers with the easiest to use

424
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,080
coding and marking systems available today

425
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
to always offer our customers

426
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
those cost-effective solutions

427
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
for all their applications

428
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
to help achieve sustainability goals

429
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
by providing the smallest

430
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
carbon footprint products

431
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
along with a peace of mind

432
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
and satisfaction

433
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
of no longer having to worry

434
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
about coding and marking their products.

435
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
With the new Leibinger IQJet,

436
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,080
we have succeeded in achieving that.

437
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,080
So, let's take a closer look

438
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
at the IQJet.

439
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
So, from the exterior you can

440
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
can't help but notice

441
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
the streamlined, timeless design

442
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,080
with the large 10.1 inch touch display

443
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
and the new print head

444
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
which now prints more content

445
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
with up to 48 dots

446
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,080
and therefore up to 8 lines of code.

447
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
But the real assets

448
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,080
and outstanding features

449
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,080
are on the inside of the new IQJet.

450
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
And this is where four intelligent

451
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
assistance systems

452
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
work together to solve

453
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
the major challenges

454
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
of coding and marking products.

455
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Not only in a way that is different

456
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
ladies and gentlemen, but also

457
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
much better than all the others.

458
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
So, let me briefly introduce

459
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
to you these four

460
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
very unique systems,

461
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
assistance systems.

462
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
First, IQ print.

463
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
The plug and print

464
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
functionality. Responsible

465
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
for everything that guarantees

466
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
excellent print quality

467
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
and the high availability

468
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
of the IQJet at all times.

469
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Second, smart OS.

470
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Responsible for the easy operation

471
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,080
and integration of the IQJet

472
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
into the production line.

473
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Third, smart efficiency.

474
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Which ensures the lowest operating costs

475
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
in the industry.

476
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
And fourth,

477
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
smart care.

478
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Which means that you won't

479
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
have to maintain the IQJet

480
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
for five years.

481
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Yes, you heard me right.

482
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
No maintenance for five years,

483
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
but more on that later.

484
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,080
So, I will now take a few minutes

485
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
to go into detail about each

486
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,080
of the intelligent assistance systems

487
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
so that you can understand

488
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,080
the unique technologies behind them.

489
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,080
So, I will start with IQ print.

490
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
As mentioned earlier,

491
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
this intelligent assistance

492
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
is responsible for

493
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,080
consistently excellent print quality.

494
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,080
The quickest start-up times

495
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,080
and extremely robust printing technology.

496
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
IQ print guarantees

497
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,080
maximum productivity in day-to-day operation.

498
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
But, how is this possible?

499
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
You may ask.

500
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,080
The unique nozzle seal

501
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
not only closes the nozzle,

502
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
but also the gutter

503
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
and the entire ink return,

504
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
sealing them completely airtight.

505
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
This creates a hydraulic,

506
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,080
odd airtight hydraulic circuit,

507
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
which is the prerequisite

508
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
for automatic circulation

509
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
of the ink through the entire system.

510
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
And it ensures that blockages

511
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
in the ink circuit or ink drying

512
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,080
are virtually impossible.

513
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,080
For our customers,

514
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
this means an exceptionally reliable system

515
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
that is available to the maps.

516
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,080
It starts up quickly when it's needed.

517
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
There is no ink spitting

518
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,080
as commonly experienced with other systems.

519
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
And perhaps best of all,

520
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
there is no need to clean

521
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
or flush the printhead

522
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
of the ink cycle,

523
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,080
as is the case with conventional inkjet printers,

524
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,080
neither at start-up or at shutdown.

525
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
But that's not all.

526
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
In addition to all these advantages,

527
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,080
the new IQ print is also significantly more robust

528
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,080
and therefore failsafe for many years to come.

529
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,080
The ink circuit closes and opens

530
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
40% faster than before,

531
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,080
so the IQ jet is ready to print even more quickly.

532
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,080
This ensures maximum availability

533
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
and reliability of the IQ jet

534
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
in its day-to-day use.

535
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Of course, the new nozzle sealing technology

536
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
and automatic ink circulation

537
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,080
are also a key to consistent print quality.

538
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
But IQ jet or IQ print

539
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
has even more to offer in this regard.

540
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,080
The new ink temperature control

541
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
keeps the ink temperature in the printhead

542
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
consistently at the right level.

543
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
At the same time,

544
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,080
the viscosity of the ink is precisely controlled,

545
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,080
thanks to a separate ink mixing tank

546
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,080
with a very small control volume

547
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,080
in conjunction with advanced algorithms.

548
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Viscosity control is now much more dynamic,

549
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
much faster and more precise

550
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,080
than with any conventional CIJ printer,

551
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
where viscosity is usually controlled

552
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
in the large reservoir,

553
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
control much more sluggish

554
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,080
and slower than with the IQ jet.

555
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
With IQ print,

556
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,080
the intelligent ink management system,

557
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,080
you no longer have to worry about print quality.

558
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,080
The IQ jet prints in the very best quality

559
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
immediately after start-up.

560
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
It continues to do so until the end of production

561
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
or even around the clock.

562
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Expensive rejects or complaints are things of the past.

563
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,080
This is what we mean by maximum customer benefit

564
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
and it is precisely why we developed IQ print.

565
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,080
So, moving on to the next intelligent

566
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,080
assistance function, SMART OS.

567
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,080
OS stands for Operating System

568
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
and this function is responsible

569
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,080
for the simple, intuitive operating system

570
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,080
as well as the easy integration of the IQ jet

571
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,080
into the production environment.

572
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Let's take a closer look.

573
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
The new IQ jet is operated

574
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,080
via a large, high-resolution 10.1-inch touch display.

575
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,080
The capacitive touch technology

576
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
enables the same operability

577
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
you benefit from with a smartphone,

578
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,080
i.e. with easy swiping, dragging, dropping, or zooming.

579
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,080
The display is very responsive,

580
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,080
it is promptly reacting to any finger touch.

581
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,080
When developing the operating concept

582
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,080
we were inspired by state-of-the-art standards

583
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,080
in design thinking and in user-centered design.

584
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,080
It is intuitively simple

585
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,080
and offers quick access to all key functions

586
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
and data at all times.

587
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,080
All essential information is clearly displayed

588
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
on the home screen

589
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
and this means that the operator

590
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
normally has no need to change the menu

591
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,080
and can always work in the familiar home screen.

592
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,080
The large, color-coordinated operating elements

593
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
make it easy to read the current status of the IQ jet.

594
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
The new remote screening

595
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,080
is a case-dependent screensaver

596
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,080
that displays the current status of the IQ jet

597
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,080
and the product counters in full-screen mode

598
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,080
working according to the traffic light principle

599
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
like a signal map.

600
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Green indicates that the IQ jet is running,

601
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,080
red the IQ jet has a malfunction

602
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,080
and blue the IQ jet is paused.

603
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,080
This makes it easy to see everything that is important

604
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
even from a distance

605
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
saving operators a few trips back and forth.

606
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
The central menu

607
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
in the lower part of the display

608
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
with only five icons

609
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,080
is used for general navigation.

610
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,080
From there you can access all main functions

611
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,080
and return to the previous menu at any time.

612
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,080
This makes it easy to find all relevant content

613
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,080
and functions.

614
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
The print job editor

615
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,080
has also been improved in great detail.

616
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,080
Numerous design or numerous templates

617
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,080
and design functions are now available.

618
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,080
This allows you to create print jobs

619
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
tailored to your specific needs

620
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
in no time at all

621
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,080
and to start them simply by the touch of a button.

622
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,080
And if an operating function is not quite clear to you,

623
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Smart OS offers so-called tool tips

624
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,080
or also known as mouseovers or quick info.

625
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
So the tool tip appears

626
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
when the finger remains motionless

627
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,080
for a short time on the respective element

628
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,080
and provides a brief description of the function.

629
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Our operating philosophy is very simple.

630
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,080
We want anyone to be able to work with our IQJet

631
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,080
without the need for manual or operator training.

632
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,080
So Smart OS ensures even more operating reliability

633
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
with myDisplay.

634
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,080
MyDisplay allows you to adapt the operations

635
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
specifically to the needs of the respective user

636
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,080
with just a few clicks

637
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
all the required settings are made

638
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,080
and the user only sees what he or she really needs

639
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
to complete his or her specific tasks

640
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,080
for instance changing the print job.

641
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Everything else is simply hidden.

642
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,080
MyDisplay is a great tool

643
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,080
that helps to virtually eliminate operating errors.

644
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,080
No less important when investing in a coding and marking system

645
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
is ease with which it can be integrated

646
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
into the production environment.

647
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,080
Here too Smart OS has a lot to offer.

648
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,080
The IQJet features a signal monitor

649
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
for the clear display of all input and output signals

650
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,080
as well as a signal simulation function.

651
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,080
So this valuable signal visualization tool

652
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
for all input and output

653
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,080
makes it easy to integrate the IQJet

654
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
into a production line.

655
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,080
For example signals wired to the inputs

656
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
can be visualized

657
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
and you can immediately see

658
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
whether a signal is present or not.

659
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,080
This means that correct wiring

660
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,080
and signal reliability can be quickly checked.

661
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Moreover output signals can also be temporarily set

662
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,080
by the IQJet to test the external wiring

663
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,080
without the need for a multimeter

664
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,080
or oscilloscope.

665
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
The integrated PLC,

666
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,080
the Programmable Logic Controller

667
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
is also new.

668
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,080
It enables the convenient linking

669
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,080
of input signals via drag and drop.

670
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080
All this without requiring any programming knowledge

671
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,080
and without additional external hardware

672
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
or extra wiring work.

673
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
With the integrated PLC,

674
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,080
printer functions and peripheral devices

675
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,080
can be triggered or controlled individually

676
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,080
depending on input or output signals.

677
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,080
The OPC-UA interface is also available

678
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
from now on.

679
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,080
OPC-UA is considered the interface standard

680
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,080
for industry 4.0.

681
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
The OPC-UA

682
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
detailed process data

683
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,080
from a wide variety of machine control types

684
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
can be read, displayed

685
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,080
and analyzed in real time.

686
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Traditional communication barriers

687
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
are now in the past.

688
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
Today virtually all PLC,

689
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,080
machine and control manufacturers

690
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
support this standard.

691
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
So connecting new production equipment

692
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
no longer takes days

693
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,080
but is usually carried out in less than an hour.

694
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Integrating the printhead

695
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
into a production line

696
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
is also made easier than ever

697
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,080
thanks to the new bus-based communication

698
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
in the IQJET.

699
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
The printhead umbilical

700
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,080
is more flexible and adaptable.

701
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,080
This means that even the tightest

702
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
installation conditions are no longer a problem

703
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
and the printhead can be placed

704
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
in optimal position

705
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,080
within the manufacturing process.

706
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,080
So let me summarize all the key features

707
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,080
of the intelligent SMART OS function.

708
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,080
SMART OS makes operating the IQJET

709
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,080
simple, fast and absolutely reliable.

710
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Any possible user operating errors

711
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,080
are reduced to a minimum.

712
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,080
All important functions are clearly organized

713
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,080
and selected without time-consuming navigation

714
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
in the operating menu.

715
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,080
The IQJET can be operated by anyone

716
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
right from the work-go.

717
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
There is no need for user training.

718
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,080
A big advantage is the simple integration

719
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,080
of the IQJET into any production environment.

720
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Many available interfaces

721
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
and an integrated PLC

722
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
make everything quicker and easier

723
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
than ever before.

724
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
And when the IQJET is fully connected

725
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
you can test everything with the help

726
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
of the signal monitor

727
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,080
and the system is ready to go into operation.

728
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Complicated was yesterday

729
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
and today is all about ease of use.

730
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
And this is exactly what we mean

731
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
by unmatched customer benefit.

732
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
So let's turn our attention

733
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
to the third intelligent assistant.

734
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,080
SMART EFFICIENCY.

735
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
SMART EFFICIENCY

736
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
ensures that the operating costs

737
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
of the IQJET

738
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,080
are reduced to an absolute minimum.

739
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,080
That resources and the environment

740
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
are respected

741
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
and that the user's well-being

742
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
is taken care of.

743
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,080
Let me show you how all this is possible.

744
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,080
With the integrated solvent recovery

745
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
evaporated solvent is condensed

746
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
from the mixing tank

747
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
and the ink return line

748
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
recovered back into the system.

749
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
SMART EFFICIENCY

750
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,080
also includes a one-of-a-kind eco mode.

751
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,080
The additional savings effects

752
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
made possible by this unique functionality

753
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
of the IQJET

754
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
should not be underestimated.

755
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
And Leibinger is the only one

756
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
who could offer this functionality.

757
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Think of it like the engine start-stop functionality

758
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,080
that is now included on almost all cars.

759
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,080
When the IQJET is not in use

760
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,080
the ink circuit closes automatically

761
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
after a predetermined time.

762
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,080
This means that no solvent can evaporate

763
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
and escape into the environment.

764
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
SMART EFFICIENCY reduces

765
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,080
solvent consumption by up to 50%.

766
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
And this of course has a direct

767
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
and very positive impact

768
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
on operating costs.

769
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Also, significantly less solvent

770
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
is released into the environment

771
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
for much better working conditions

772
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
and the best possible protection

773
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,080
of employee health and well-being.

774
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
SMART EFFICIENCY

775
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,080
not only minimizes solvent consumption

776
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,080
but it also saves a considerable amount of energy.

777
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
All components of the IQJET

778
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,080
are designed for lowest energy consumption.

779
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
The intelligently controlled pump

780
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
plays a major role here

781
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,080
as it is only operated intermittently.

782
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,080
Unlike conventional printers

783
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
where the pump runs continuously

784
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,080
with the IQJET it only switches on briefly

785
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
to fill a pressure tank.

786
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
This reduces the energy consumption

787
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
of the pump to a minimum

788
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,080
and it also maximizes the durability of the pump.

789
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Thanks to SMART EFFICIENCY

790
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,080
the IQJET consumes only 36 watts on average.

791
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Conventional printers need many times that.

792
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,080
The IQJET boasts the lowest energy consumption

793
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
on the market.

794
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Now, moving on to our entirely new cartridge system

795
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,080
and I can rightly say

796
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,080
the best cartridge system in our industry.

797
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Why?

798
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Because no other system is easier,

799
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,080
no other system is quicker to replace

800
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,080
and no other system saves as much anything.

801
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,080
The new XXL cartridges can hold 950 milliliters

802
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,080
which means very large refills of ink and solvent.

803
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,080
If necessary, the quick loading system

804
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,080
allows the cartridges to be inserted

805
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
without getting mixed up.

806
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
This means that the ink and solvent cartridges

807
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,080
can only fit into the respective refill slot.

808
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,080
The type of consumable is also automatically checked

809
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,080
for consistency before refilling

810
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,080
and the operator is warned of any incorrect filling.

811
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Thanks to the front access

812
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,080
and the special cartridge design

813
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,080
refilling the IQJET is quicker, easier

814
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
and more convenient than ever

815
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,080
and of course also during ongoing printing operation.

816
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,080
As mentioned earlier, changing cartridges is very easy

817
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,080
but to make it possible for anyone to do it

818
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,080
without training and interactive assistant

819
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,080
guides the operator through the process step by step.

820
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Another new feature is that the cartridges

821
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,080
can be reordered via the integrated shop system

822
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,080
and added convenience in day-to-day operation.

823
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Once the cartridges have been inserted,

824
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,080
the fluid is immediately emptied

825
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,080
into the internal storage tanks.

826
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,080
This extends the reserve runtimes to up to 50 hours

827
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
enough time to order consumables

828
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,080
even after the refill message on the display.

829
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,080
When I say emptied, I mean totally emptied.

830
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Unlike most conventional CIG printers

831
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,080
where considerable amounts of ink remain in the cartridges,

832
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,080
our XXL cartridges empty down to the last drop of ink.

833
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,080
This saves money and the cartridges can simply be disposed of

834
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
in the residual waste,

835
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,080
otherwise it becomes expensive hazardous waste.

836
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
I'd like to summarize what makes

837
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,080
the smart efficiency intelligence assistance function so unique.

838
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Smart efficiency saves our customers money every day.

839
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,080
The IQJETs operating costs are the lowest in the industry,

840
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,080
up to 50% less solvent consumption,

841
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
low energy costs,

842
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
and, very importantly,

843
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
the environment and the operator are protected

844
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,080
to the greatest possible extent.

845
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Moreover, the new cartridge system

846
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,080
saves a lot of ink due to complete emptying

847
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
and the reserve runtimes of consumables

848
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,080
are an incredible 50 hours.

849
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,080
I don't like repeating myself, but I will anyway.

850
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,080
This is what we mean by maximum customer benefit.

851
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,080
We have talked about reducing operating costs to a minimum.

852
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Now I would like to move on to the last of the four intelligent functions.

853
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Thanks to smart care,

854
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:54,080
the new Leibinger IQJET needs no maintenance for five years.

855
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:01,080
That means five years printing, printing, printing with no maintenance.

856
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,080
This is achieved thanks to many technical innovations,

857
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
such as the new housing

858
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,080
with the increased protection against water and dust as standard,

859
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,080
use of the most durable and high quality components,

860
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,080
the new printhead with its precision parts

861
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,080
manufactured in the Leibinger production facilities

862
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,080
down to micron accuracy,

863
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,080
and the most intelligent hydraulic ink circulation system,

864
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:37,080
which ensures a much longer service life for the print pump and other components.

865
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:42,080
In addition, smart care offers the fully automated printhead refresh

866
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
at the touch of the button.

867
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,080
It removes ink related contamination from the printhead,

868
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,080
which could occur in extreme customer applications,

869
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,080
and it maintains the printhead in a safe and clean manner.

870
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,080
A fine spray solvent is directed from the gutter

871
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,080
to specific locations in the printhead.

872
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,080
The ink gutter moves up and down to remove any impurities.

873
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Afterwards, a complete automatic drying takes place

874
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,080
and everything is impeccably clean and dry

875
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,080
without requiring any manual intervention

876
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,080
and without the operator coming into contact with cleaning fluid.

877
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,080
That is absolutely unique.

878
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,080
And when it's finally time for maintenance after five years,

879
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,080
customers are free to do it themselves if they wish.

880
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Do it yourself or DIY maintenance is the catch word here.

881
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,080
And if we say this, we actually mean it.

882
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Step by step, the operator is shown on the display

883
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
what they have to do.

884
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Even unskilled workers can carry out the maintenance.

885
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,080
No special tools are necessary.

886
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Yes, maintenance can be this easy with the IQJet.

887
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Our customers greatly benefit from zero waiting times

888
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
for customer service, better planning,

889
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,080
and ultimately a real plus in production time.

890
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Ladies and gentlemen, these four intelligent functions

891
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,080
make the IQJet the coding and marking system

892
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,080
with the lowest operating costs in the industry.

893
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Let me give you a tangible example.

894
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,080
A manufacturer in the FMCG sector

895
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,080
with 5,000 production hours per year

896
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
and 400 prints per minute

897
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,080
with 20-character prints,

898
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,080
a typical application,

899
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,080
saves more than 1,360 euros in the first year alone.

900
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Within eight years,

901
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,080
this adds up to almost 11,000 euros saved

902
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,080
compared to conventional Cij printers.

903
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,080
This makes the IQJet ideally suited

904
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,080
for cost-sensitive applications,

905
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
such as in the food and beverage sector

906
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,080
or in the FMCG segment in general.

907
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,080
It is the most versatile, cost-effective,

908
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:16,080
productive and durable coding and marking system in the world.

909
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Finally, a coding and marking system

910
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,080
that gives customers consistent performance

911
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
without any intervention.

912
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,080
You install it and you almost forget.

913
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
Plug and print five years,

914
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,080
no maintenance in simply printing, printing, printing.

915
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,080
This is exactly what the four new

916
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
intelligent technologies were designed for

917
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,080
and what they guarantee.

918
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Last but certainly not least,

919
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
I would like to briefly highlight

920
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Liveanger Connect.

921
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,080
When the IQJet is connected to Liveanger Connect,

922
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
everything becomes easier

923
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,080
and, above all, even more efficient.

924
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
With Liveanger Connect,

925
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
the user is always well-informed

926
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,080
and has everything important in view,

927
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,080
whether the IQJet's current status,

928
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,080
previews of required actions such as

929
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,080
refill ink, the reach of consumables

930
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
or even the production output.

931
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,080
All information is displayed simply and clearly.

932
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,080
This also helps users react at an early stage

933
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
so that the production line does not come

934
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,080
to an unwanted standstill in the first place.

935
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,080
If wanted, the user can also be kept up to date

936
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
via push message, for example,

937
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
in the event of a malfunction.

938
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,080
In addition, historical data helps

939
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,080
identify and leverage any potential

940
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
for production optimization.

941
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,080
The modern cloud system is the

942
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
high performance platform

943
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,080
for all connected Liveanger printing systems,

944
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
regardless of whether they are connected

945
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,080
via LAN or cellular network.

946
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Y, if required,

947
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,080
service partners can also be easily integrated.

948
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,080
They can access the IQJet data remotely

949
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
and provide targeted support

950
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,080
on all important service issues.

951
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,080
The use of Liveanger Connect

952
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,080
increases the productivity and efficiency

953
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,080
of all connected printers in day to day use

954
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,080
and provides the additional certainty

955
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,080
that everything is under control.

956
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

957
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm at the end of my presentation

958
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
and now I hope you enjoy

959
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
our new product video.

960
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
Thank you very much.

961
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Every great idea begins with a clear starting point.

962
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Here lies the power of change,

963
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,080
of innovation.

964
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,080
A thought begins its journey,

965
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
simple and ingenious.

966
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:15,080
And the unimaginable becomes reality.

967
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Time and time again,

968
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
we at Liveanger challenge the conventions

969
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
of an entire industry

970
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
and create solutions that are simpler,

971
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,080
smarter, more intelligent.

972
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,080
Introducing the new IQJet,

973
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
the very first intelligent coding

974
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
and marketing system worldwide.

975
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Trouble-free printing guaranteed.

976
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
No matter what shape,

977
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,080
no matter what surface.

978
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
With IQ Print,

979
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,080
the most intelligent ink management.

980
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
When not in use,

981
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
IQ Print automatically closes

982
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
the print nozzle

983
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
and lets the ink continue to circulate.

984
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
No dry out, no clogging.

985
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Also thanks to Liveanger's

986
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
unique print and refresh function

987
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
which removes impurities

988
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,080
at the press of a button.

989
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
IQ Print ensures instant start-up

990
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
every time

991
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
and stable, high-quantity printing.

992
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Easy to use with Smart OS,

993
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,080
the IQJet's intuitive operating concept,

994
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
individually adjustable

995
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,080
and clearly visible.

996
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Printing has never been this easy

997
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
or this cost-effective

998
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
because Smart Efficiency

999
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
minimizes not only your energy consumption,

1000
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
it also achieves up to 50%

1001
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
salt and recovery,

1002
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
protecting your health and the environment

1003
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,080
and saving money.

1004
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Just like the XXL cartridges,

1005
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
they are quickly replaced

1006
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,080
and emptied down to the last drop.

1007
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
And finally,

1008
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,080
we're introducing Smart Care,

1009
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,080
printing 5 years without maintenance.

1010
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,080
The new IQJet.

1011
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Intelligence on point.

1012
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Good afternoon everybody.

1013
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
My name is Christophe Lopez.

1014
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,080
I joined Liveanger

1015
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
as Chief Commercial Officer

1016
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
at the beginning of March.

1017
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
I'm really happy to be here today

1018
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
to be able to meet you

1019
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,080
our customers and our partners.

1020
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
I've made many appointments

1021
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
with many of you,

1022
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
but if this is not the case,

1023
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
don't hesitate to reach out to me.

1024
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
If you want to talk,

1025
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
I'll be more than happy to share

1026
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,080
and spend time with you.

1027
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
I've been in the marketing and coding industry

1028
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
for nearly 15 years,

1029
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,080
including 12 years with Marketing Match,

1030
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,080
where I held a multiple executive position

1031
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
in sales and marketing,

1032
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,080
as well as general management

1033
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,080
of the main site in France.

1034
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Before that,

1035
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
I was already in the industry

1036
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
working for Everyday Nissan

1037
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
and Honeywell.

1038
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,080
I decided to join Liveanger

1039
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
because it is structurally different

1040
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
from the rest of the competitors,

1041
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,080
being a private company

1042
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
with strong values

1043
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,080
and a great innovative mindset.

1044
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
I really see great potential

1045
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
for development in the coming years.

1046
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
I can also tell you

1047
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
that being part of the company now,

1048
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
I'm even more impressed

1049
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
about the people, the technology

1050
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,080
and the mindset.

1051
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
I'm particularly impressed

1052
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
by how Liveanger

1053
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,080
is changing the game in CIG.

1054
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
CIG is a great technology

1055
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,080
when it was invented 40 years ago.

1056
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
It rechained the game

1057
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,080
at the time in the marketing and coding industry

1058
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,080
by allowing the printing of valuable data

1059
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,080
on a large variety of substrates

1060
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
at high production speeds.

1061
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,080
That was a revolution

1062
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
to guarantee the trustability

1063
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,080
and the freshness of products.

1064
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
The issue of CIG

1065
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
from the start

1066
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,080
was that it was a complex

1067
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,080
and not very reliable technology.

1068
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,080
Printers would eventually not start

1069
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
or would stop unexpectedly

1070
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,080
o would spilling on the floor

1071
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
and quality of prints

1072
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
would vary over time.

1073
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,080
It would also be quite costly to operate

1074
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,080
using large quantities of fluid

1075
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,080
and a lot of spare parts.

1076
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,080
The main CIG manufacturers

1077
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
tried to solve these problems

1078
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,080
by implementing incremental enhancement

1079
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
to reduce these issues

1080
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,080
but none of them really addressed

1081
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
the problem at the core

1082
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,080
and instead they deployed armies of technicians

1083
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,080
to maintain and repair the machines.

1084
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,080
But this is history now

1085
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,080
with the launch of IQChat.

1086
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,080
How would you, customers and partners

1087
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,080
define the ultimate

1088
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,080
marking and coding machine?

1089
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,080
I believe whether you are a production manager,

1090
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,080
a quality manager, maintenance manager,

1091
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,080
even a finance manager

1092
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,080
what you want is one single thing.

1093
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,080
You want a printer that you install easily

1094
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,080
and then that will print seamlessly

1095
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,080
as needed without having to intervene.

1096
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,080
You install it and you almost forget it.

1097
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Productivity and low operating cost.

1098
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Albert Einstein said the definition of genius

1099
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,080
is taking the complex

1100
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,080
and making it simple.

1101
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,080
IQChat is the first printer

1102
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,080
that is really changing the game

1103
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,080
since the invention of CIG

1104
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,080
based on two unique features

1105
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,080
which are simple to understand

1106
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,080
and yet extremely complex to implement.

1107
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
The number one concept

1108
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,080
is that the head is sealed.

1109
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,080
Let me take an image.

1110
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:08,080
Look at that kind of paint.

1111
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,080
If it's sealed,

1112
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,080
it can stay perfect for many years

1113
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,080
but just open the trap

1114
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,080
and it will dry in only a few hours.

1115
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
With live in your IQChat,

1116
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,080
the ink will never dry

1117
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,080
and the viscosity will stay stable

1118
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:33,080
allowing perfect operation in all conditions.

1119
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,080
I would like to take a second image.

1120
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,080
This is what I call the balloon concept.

1121
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,080
The way the in-circuit works in IQChat

1122
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,080
is that you inflate once

1123
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,080
and then you just need to bring a small quantity of air

1124
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,080
to keep it inflated over time.

1125
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,080
That means that the entire system

1126
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,080
is working only a small fraction of the time

1127
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,080
and why the reliability of IQChat is unmatched.

1128
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,080
The competitor's machine,

1129
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
even the most recent ones,

1130
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,080
are continuously pumping

1131
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,080
to maintain pressure in the in-circuit

1132
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,080
and therefore their printers

1133
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,080
are going to fail early.

1134
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,080
Whatever they say or whatever they do.

1135
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,080
With these two principles,

1136
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,080
the IQChat printer redefines

1137
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,080
the market standards for reliability

1138
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,080
and autonomy in marking and coding.

1139
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Its unique disruptive design

1140
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,080
will transform the industry's experience

1141
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,080
working with CIG.

1142
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,080
100% clean,

1143
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,080
seamless start and stops,

1144
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,080
5-year operation

1145
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,080
without schedule maintenance

1146
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,080
and un parallel cost of a machine.

1147
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,080
Plug and print,

1148
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,080
the ultimate printing machine.

1149
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,080
This is the CIG we invented.

1150
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,080
And now I would like to introduce

1151
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,080
Christophe Orish,

1152
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,080
our director of sales EMEA

1153
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,080
and HAPAC,

1154
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,080
that will tell you how we plan to work together with you

1155
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,080

00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,080
into a huge commercial success.

1157
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,080
Thank you very much.

1158
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,080
Gracias, Christophe.

1159
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,080
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1160
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,080
Now that you have seen the smartest coding

1161
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,080
and marking system in the industry,

1162
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,080
please give me the chance to talk to you

1163
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,080
about the go-to-market strategy for this product

1164
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,080
and some relevant tools

1165
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,080
that will help you expand your business success

1166
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,080
together with the Lighting On.

1167
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,080
For us, the introduction of the completely new platform

1168
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,080
represents an important milestone,

1169
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,080
a massive technological step

1170
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,080
with strategic importance.

1171
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,080
And to this extent,

1172
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,080
we would like you to benefit from the IQChat

1173
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,080
as a partner and customer.

1174
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,080
With the IQChat,

1175
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,080
we will, on the one hand,

1176
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,080
address existing, convinced customers,

1177
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,080
as well as penetrate new markets

1178
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,080
to sustainably grow our market share.

1179
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,080
With its competitive price point

1180
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,080
and in combination with the exceptionally low operating cost,

1181
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,080
the IQChat is the ideal coding marking system

1182
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,080
for a very broad range of applications

1183
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,080
in virtually all segments of modern manufacturing.

1184
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,080
With this in mind,

1185
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,080
we would be working with you

1186
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,080
to target new customer segments

1187
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,080
and communicate the IQChat benefit message

1188
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,080
with high-level impact.

1189
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,080
We have started worldwide marketing activities

1190
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,080
as of immediately,

1191
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,080
and we are supporting this process

1192
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,080
by professional communication measures.

1193
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,080
This means stepping up social media communication

1194
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,080
and newsletters,

1195
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,080
participating in trade fairs around the globe,

1196
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,080

1197
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,080
benefit-focused campaigns and promotions,

1198
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,080
a key account customer roadshow,

1199
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,080
and, last but not least,

1200
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:23,080
we will be going after our potential customers directly.

1201
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,080
We also have attractive point-of-sale packages

1202
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,080
ready for you,

1203
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,080
as well as in brochures, data sheets,

1204
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,080
and website content, of course,

1205
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,080
which you can easily integrate into your website.

1206
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,080
So, everything you need to successfully introduce

1207
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,080
the IQChat is now available.

1208
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,080
Of course, we are relying on you, our partners.

1209
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,080
Because only together with you

1210
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,080
will we be able to drive the marketing

1211
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,080

00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,080
and we will be supporting you wherever necessary

1213
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,080
so that we can achieve these goals together.

1214
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,080
We will begin training your sales teams immediately

1215
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,080
so that they can effectively communicate

1216
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,080
the many benefits of the IQChat.

1217
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
We will also train your service staff

1218
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
to ensure that the installation

1219
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,080
and predictive maintenance of the IQChat

1220
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,080
runs smoothly.

1221
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,080
We will be letting you know today

1222
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,080
when the training sessions will be held.

1223
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,080
Right after this event,

1224
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,080
you will also find out the exact price positioning

1225
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,080
of the IQChat.

1226
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,080
At the same time,

1227
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,080
the price point is extremely attractive,

1228
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,080
and when you consider the fact

1229
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
that the IQChat has the lowest operating costs

1230
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
in the industry

1231
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,080
and includes many useful functions,

1232
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,080
the package really is unbeatable.

1233
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,080
Overall, a completely new benchmark

1234
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,080
for total cost of ownership.

1235
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,080
So, let me now briefly explain

1236
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,080
what's next on today's agenda.

1237
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,080
Following the presentation,

1238
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,080
our complete team will be available

1239
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,080

00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,080
We have set up a small marketplace

1245
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,080
in this room and in the adjoining room.

1246
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
The various market stations

1247
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,080
cover different relevant subjects

1248
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,080
of the market launch of the IQChat.

as well as marketing information.

00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
So, everything that is required

1258
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,080
for a successful launch.

1259
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,080
Of course, you can also try out

1260
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,080

1261
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,080

1262
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,080
Some refreshments and finger food

1263
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,080
will be available for you there

1264
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,080

1266
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,080
In the further course,

1267
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
we will have the main course buffet

1276
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,080
We are very much looking forward

1277
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,080
to sharing ideas with you

00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,080
