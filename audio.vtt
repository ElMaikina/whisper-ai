00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
Hace varios últimos años tenemos

00:04.520 --> 00:08.440
Between the

00:10.060 --> 00:14.480
En raíz deANDbijanc

00:14.480 --> 00:18.620
está la

00:18.620 --> 00:23.640
cataria.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.080
S 다양한

00:26.080 --> 00:28.080
en muchos años.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.080
También en los próximos años,

00:30.080 --> 00:33.080
vemos a la visión de los potenciales de crecimiento

00:33.080 --> 00:35.080
en varios sectores,

00:35.080 --> 00:38.080
particularmente en los sectores de consumidores

00:38.080 --> 00:41.080
o el sector FMCG,

00:41.080 --> 00:43.080
incluyendo las industrias de producción de comida

00:43.080 --> 00:45.080
y beverage.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.080
En realidad, vemos el potencial de crecimiento

00:47.080 --> 00:49.080
más grande para nuestras soluciones de encodimiento

00:49.080 --> 00:52.080
y marcando de una perspectiva global.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.080
Con esto en mente,

00:54.080 --> 00:56.080
el mercado de encodimiento y marcando

00:56.080 --> 00:58.080
es de la importancia estratégica más alta

00:58.080 --> 01:00.080
para el livrador

01:00.080 --> 01:02.080
y estamos enfocando todos nuestros esfuerzos

01:02.080 --> 01:04.080
en seguir expandiendo la posición del livrador

01:04.080 --> 01:07.080
y las fuerzas en este área.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.080
En este contexto,

01:09.080 --> 01:10.080
los investimientos significativos

01:10.080 --> 01:12.080
han sido realizados en el pasado

01:12.080 --> 01:15.080
y van a seguir realizando en los próximos años.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.080
Esto envuelve los investimientos

01:17.080 --> 01:20.080
en nuestra presencia global.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.080
Mientras tenemos una subsidiaría en los Estados Unidos since 1974,

01:24.080 --> 01:26.080
hemos establecido un centro de competencia

01:26.080 --> 01:29.080
en China en 2022.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.080
En paralelo,

01:31.080 --> 01:33.080
hemos expandido nuestra red mundial

01:33.080 --> 01:35.080
de compañías de negociación.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.080
Estos grandes pasos fueron acompañados

01:37.080 --> 01:41.080
por más investimientos en salas y marketing.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.080
Estamos seguros de que solo podemos ser

01:43.080 --> 01:45.080
succesivos en nuestra industria

01:45.080 --> 01:47.080
si entendemos a nuestros clientes

01:47.080 --> 01:49.080
los desafíos y los necesarios

01:49.080 --> 01:51.080
en las diferentes aplicaciones mejor

01:51.080 --> 01:53.080
que a nadie más.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.080
Solo podemos darles a nuestros clientes

01:55.080 --> 01:57.080
con el beneficio más alto posible.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.080
Para hacer esto,

01:59.080 --> 02:01.080
es el elemento que vemos

02:01.080 --> 02:03.080
en las aplicaciones específicas

02:03.080 --> 02:05.080
y en los desafíos en detalle.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.080
En términos de una solución comprensiva

02:07.080 --> 02:09.080
para el producto, coden y marcando,

02:09.080 --> 02:11.080
esto también significa

02:11.080 --> 02:13.080
que podemos ofer

02:13.080 --> 02:15.080
alta calidad de ingres

02:15.080 --> 02:17.080
para una gran cantidad de aplicaciones.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.080
Y estamos succesivos en hacer esto

02:19.080 --> 02:21.080
muy suficientemente.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.080
En 2021,

02:23.080 --> 02:25.080
hemos fortalecido

02:25.080 --> 02:27.080
nuestras experiencias

02:27.080 --> 02:29.080
en el área de ingeniería de ingres

02:29.080 --> 02:30.080
por establecer nuestra propia

02:30.080 --> 02:32.080
investigación y desarrollo

02:32.080 --> 02:35.080
laboratorio en el estado de equipamiento de arte.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.080
La expansión de competencia

02:37.080 --> 02:39.080
también ha llevado a la adquisición

02:39.080 --> 02:41.080
de solución de ingres

02:41.080 --> 02:42.080
y la integración

02:42.080 --> 02:44.080
en la organización o grupo.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.080
Desde entonces,

02:45.080 --> 02:47.080
hemos estado empujando

02:47.080 --> 02:49.080
con el desarrollo más alto

02:49.080 --> 02:51.080
de una gran variedad de tipos de ingres

02:51.080 --> 02:53.080
especialmente para las aplicaciones desafíos.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.080
Porque entendemos

02:55.080 --> 02:57.080
que solo podemos lograr

02:57.080 --> 02:59.080
un resultado perfecto

02:59.080 --> 03:01.080
cuando tecnología y ingres

03:01.080 --> 03:03.080
trabajan perfectamente.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.080
Así que,

03:05.080 --> 03:06.080
estamos bien posicionados

03:06.080 --> 03:07.080
para darles el mejor coden

03:07.080 --> 03:09.080

la mejor solución posible

03:12.080 --> 03:14.080
para nuestros clientes.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.080
Y cuando digo

03:15.080 --> 03:16.080
nosotros,

03:16.080 --> 03:18.080
estoy hablando principalmente de vosotros,

03:18.080 --> 03:19.080
nuestros compañeros de trabajo

03:19.080 --> 03:22.080
y experiencias del mundo.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.080
Sin tus pasos y experiencias,

03:24.080 --> 03:27.080
no pudimos lograr esto.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.080
Solo con vosotros

03:28.080 --> 03:30.080
podemos dar máximo beneficio

03:30.080 --> 03:32.080
a nuestros clientes,

03:32.080 --> 03:34.080

por estas grandes colaboraciones.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.080
Gracias.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:33.080 --> 04:34.080
como pueden ver,

04:34.080 --> 04:36.080
no tendríamos ni idea

04:36.080 --> 04:37.080
si nos justizamos

04:37.080 --> 04:38.080
y nos congratulamos

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
a nosotros

04:39.080 --> 04:41.080
en nuestros sucesos.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
En cooperación

04:42.080 --> 04:43.080
con nuestros compañeros

04:43.080 --> 04:45.080
y en una coordinación

04:45.080 --> 04:46.080
con los clientes,

04:46.080 --> 04:47.080
nuestros expertos

04:47.080 --> 04:48.080
han intensivamente

04:48.080 --> 04:49.080
explorado

04:49.080 --> 04:50.080
los trens significativos

04:50.080 --> 04:51.080
que forman

04:51.080 --> 04:52.080
el futuro

04:52.080 --> 04:54.080
de la industria de packaging

04:54.080 --> 04:57.080
y la manufacturación de los productos.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.080
Como nos progresamos

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
durante el XXI.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
Centro,

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
estamos creciendo

05:01.080 --> 05:02.080
un demando más

05:02.080 --> 05:04.080
para las soluciones

05:04.080 --> 05:05.080
de la packaging.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.080
El riesgo de automación

05:07.080 --> 05:08.080
y digitalización

05:08.080 --> 05:10.080
y procesos de producción.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.080
Y el impacto

05:11.080 --> 05:13.080
de las escuelas laborales

05:13.080 --> 05:15.080
en nuestras industrias.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
Los manufacturadores

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
ahora investen

05:17.080 --> 05:19.080
en materiales innovativos

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
y están enfocando

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
en reducir

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
sus colegas

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
para los precios

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
para los demandos

05:24.080 --> 05:26.080
evolucionados.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
Primero

05:27.080 --> 05:28.080
y foremost,

05:28.080 --> 05:29.080
el tren

05:29.080 --> 05:30.080
contra la sustanibilidad

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
se ha convertido

05:31.080 --> 05:34.080
en un aspecto indispensable.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.080
Consumores

05:35.080 --> 05:36.080
y empresas

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
alike

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
están empujando

05:38.080 --> 05:40.080
para materiales ecofriendos,

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
packaging

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
recyclable

05:42.080 --> 05:44.080
y la reducción en el peso.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.080
Este riesgo

05:45.080 --> 05:46.080
se ha convertido

05:46.080 --> 05:47.080
no solo

05:47.080 --> 05:49.080
en conservencias mentales

05:49.080 --> 05:50.080
pero también

05:50.080 --> 05:51.080
por las presiones

05:51.080 --> 05:52.080
regulatorias

05:52.080 --> 05:53.080
y el avance

05:53.080 --> 05:54.080
de los impactos

05:54.080 --> 05:55.080
de nuestras acciones

05:55.080 --> 05:57.080
en el planeta.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.080
Más sobre,

05:58.080 --> 05:59.080
automación

05:59.080 --> 06:01.080
y digitalización

06:01.080 --> 06:03.080
están revolucionando

06:03.080 --> 06:05.080
la landscapes de producción,

06:05.080 --> 06:07.080
operaciones

06:07.080 --> 06:08.080
y el avance de recursos

06:08.080 --> 06:10.080
optimizados.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.080
Advances

06:12.080 --> 06:13.080
en robotics

06:13.080 --> 06:15.080
y inteligencia artificiales

06:15.080 --> 06:17.080
y las cosas internetas

06:17.080 --> 06:18.080
están enviando

06:18.080 --> 06:19.080
a las empresas

06:19.080 --> 06:20.080
para monitorar

06:20.080 --> 06:21.080
y controlar

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
sus procesos

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
con una presión

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
imprescindible

06:24.080 --> 06:25.080
y

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
creer

06:26.080 --> 06:27.080
la eficiencia

06:27.080 --> 06:28.080
y reducir

06:28.080 --> 06:30.080
los costos de producción.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.080
Estas tecnologías

06:32.080 --> 06:33.080
también se mitigan

06:33.080 --> 06:34.080
los efectos

06:34.080 --> 06:36.080
de la escuelta laboral

06:36.080 --> 06:38.080
de automación

06:38.080 --> 06:39.080
de tareas complexas

06:39.080 --> 06:40.080
y traer

06:40.080 --> 06:41.080
nuevos trabajadores

06:41.080 --> 06:43.080
a un precio más rápido.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.080
La escuelta laboral

06:45.080 --> 06:46.080
de la escuelta

06:46.080 --> 06:47.080
se ha convertido

06:47.080 --> 06:48.080
en un issue

06:48.080 --> 06:49.080
crítico

06:49.080 --> 06:50.080
en el packaging

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
y en los sectores de manufactura

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
con un impacto

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
significativo

06:53.080 --> 06:54.080
en ambos

06:54.080 --> 06:55.080
cruces

06:55.080 --> 06:56.080
y innovaciones.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.080
Estas empresas

06:58.080 --> 06:59.080
están creviendo

06:59.080 --> 07:00.080
con una fuerza de trabajo

07:00.080 --> 07:01.080
y un poco

07:01.080 --> 07:02.080
de talento

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
entrando en la industria.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.080
Esta escuelta

07:06.080 --> 07:08.080
se ha accesorizado

07:08.080 --> 07:09.080
por el precio rápido

07:09.080 --> 07:11.080
de los avances tecnológicos

07:11.080 --> 07:12.080
requeriendo

07:12.080 --> 07:13.080
trabajadores

07:13.080 --> 07:14.080
para procesar

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
una escuelta laboral

07:16.080 --> 07:17.080
que incluye

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
tanto

07:18.080 --> 07:19.080
la creación tradicional

07:19.080 --> 07:20.080
y

07:20.080 --> 07:22.080
la proficiencia digital.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.080
La escuelta laboral

07:25.080 --> 07:26.080
se ha convertido

07:26.080 --> 07:27.080
en esta fuerza

07:27.080 --> 07:28.080
y no solo en el que

07:28.080 --> 07:29.080
sus clientes

07:29.080 --> 07:30.080
se adaptan

07:30.080 --> 07:31.080
y rechazan

07:31.080 --> 07:32.080
esta escuelta laboral

07:32.080 --> 07:34.080
pero también contribúan

07:34.080 --> 07:35.080
a un futuro más

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
sustaino

07:36.080 --> 07:37.080
y equitable

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
para todo el futuro.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.080
Como siempre

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
hemos estado prensas

07:42.080 --> 07:45.080
en la escuelta laboral

07:45.080 --> 07:46.580
explorando nuevas

07:46.580 --> 07:47.580
formas de hacer

07:47.580 --> 07:48.080
coden

07:48.080 --> 07:49.080
y marcar

07:49.080 --> 07:50.080
más simple,

07:50.080 --> 07:51.080
más flexibles

07:51.080 --> 07:52.080
y más eficientes.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.080
Y durante este tiempo

07:55.080 --> 07:56.080
hemos nunca perdido

07:56.080 --> 07:57.080
la escuelta laboral

07:57.080 --> 07:58.080
más valiente

07:58.080 --> 08:00.080
de la escuelta laboral.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.080
En otros casos

08:02.080 --> 08:03.080
hemos estado

08:03.080 --> 08:04.080
procurando

08:04.080 --> 08:05.080
soluciones

08:05.080 --> 08:06.080
para encontrar

08:06.080 --> 08:07.080
los desafíos

08:07.080 --> 08:08.080
del futuro.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.080
¡Inteligencia!

08:20.080 --> 08:21.080
High expectations

08:21.080 --> 08:24.080
lead to extraordinary solutions.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.080
Solutions that follow a vision

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
not a path.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.080
Solutions

08:31.080 --> 08:33.080
that are smarter,

08:33.080 --> 08:35.080
better,

08:35.080 --> 08:37.080
more intelligent.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.080
Our aspiration

08:40.080 --> 08:41.080
is to provide

08:41.080 --> 08:42.080
best possible

08:42.080 --> 08:43.080
customer solutions.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.080
Simplify operation,

08:48.080 --> 08:50.080
ensuring quality,

08:50.080 --> 08:52.080
secure efficiency.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.080
Every lightninger is designed

08:55.080 --> 08:57.080
with this aspiration in mind.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.080
Intelligence.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.080
That's the vision

09:02.080 --> 09:04.080
for which we are pioneers.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.080
This is precisely why we focus

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
our research and development

09:12.080 --> 09:14.080
activities on intelligence early on.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.080
We were the first in our industry

09:17.080 --> 09:18.080
to do so,

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
to further expand

09:19.080 --> 09:21.080
our technological leadership.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.080
We invented intelligent technology

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
and have succeeded

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
in developing it

09:26.080 --> 09:28.080
into cutting edge products

09:28.080 --> 09:30.080
that really make a difference.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.080
For many years we have been generating

09:33.080 --> 09:35.080
significant customer benefit

09:35.080 --> 09:38.080
thanks to intelligent technology.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.080
Not for the sake of technology,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
but technology that delivers

09:42.080 --> 09:43.080
the right solution

09:43.080 --> 09:45.080
when you need them.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.080
Technology that makes coding

09:47.080 --> 09:48.080
and marking easier

09:48.080 --> 09:50.080
and ensures real efficiency

09:50.080 --> 09:51.080
and productivity,

09:51.080 --> 09:53.080
which is what customers

09:53.080 --> 09:54.080
demand and expect

09:54.080 --> 09:56.080
for their day-to-day operations.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:59.080 --> 10:00.080
once again,

10:00.080 --> 10:02.080
the time has come for us

10:02.080 --> 10:04.080
to take another pioneering step.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.080
We have listened to our customers

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
very closely.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.080
We have analyzed and understood

10:10.080 --> 10:11.080
what drives them.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.080
We have visited our customers

10:14.080 --> 10:16.080
and tuned into their needs.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.080
We have recognized their challenges.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.080
We have also conducted extensive research

10:24.080 --> 10:26.080
and parallel to all this,

10:26.080 --> 10:28.080
we searched for new technologies

10:28.080 --> 10:30.080
and sent out our engineers

10:30.080 --> 10:32.080
and applicant consultants

10:32.080 --> 10:34.080
on a clear mission

10:34.080 --> 10:37.080
to set an all new standard.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.080
We questioned basically everything

10:41.080 --> 10:43.080
because if you really want

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
to set a new benchmark,

10:44.080 --> 10:47.080
you must explore new ways of thinking,

10:47.080 --> 10:49.080
thinking outside the box,

10:49.080 --> 10:51.080
looking ahead,

10:51.080 --> 10:53.080
assessing trends,

10:53.080 --> 10:56.080
rejecting wrong paths with courage,

10:56.080 --> 10:58.080
at times, taking detours.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.080
Sometimes it comes down to taking

11:02.080 --> 11:03.080
the good things

11:03.080 --> 11:05.080
and making them even better.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.080
And we have recognized

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
that to create something

11:08.080 --> 11:10.080
entirely new and better,

11:10.080 --> 11:13.080
we need to focus even more closely

11:13.080 --> 11:15.080
on one very specific topic

11:15.080 --> 11:17.080
in our research and development.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.080
Intelligence.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.080
Real intelligence

11:23.080 --> 11:26.080
that delivers more simplicity,

11:26.080 --> 11:28.080
more efficiency

11:28.080 --> 11:30.080
and more flexibility.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.080
In short,

11:32.080 --> 11:34.080
much more customer benefit

11:34.080 --> 11:36.080
and a lot more excited

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
inspired customers.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.080
This is exactly

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
what we have accomplished.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:45.080 --> 11:48.080
the time has finally come.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.080
Today, here and now,

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
you will experience

11:51.080 --> 11:54.080
the most intelligent printing technology

11:54.080 --> 11:56.080
in the world.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.080
Experience our new

11:58.080 --> 12:01.080
live-agent coding and marking system,

12:01.080 --> 12:04.080
the new world standard.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.080
www.mooji.org

13:03.080 --> 13:06.080
www.mooji.org

13:06.080 --> 13:08.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
here they are,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.080
the new intelligence coding

13:11.080 --> 13:14.080
and marking systems from the library.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.080
First and only ones of their time,

13:17.080 --> 13:20.080
the new Leibinger IQJet.

13:20.080 --> 13:24.080
This is where tremendous application knowledge

13:24.080 --> 13:27.080
meets the art of engineering.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.080
With the IQJet from Leibinger,

13:29.080 --> 13:33.080
we are introducing an all-new generation

13:33.080 --> 13:36.080
of intelligent coding and marking systems.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.080
And they are geared towards a single goal,

13:39.080 --> 13:41.080
to offer our customers

13:41.080 --> 13:43.080
the greatest possible benefit

13:43.080 --> 13:45.080
in day-to-day use.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.080
Or to put it even more simply,

13:47.080 --> 13:49.080
to offer more than everyone else.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.080
And to us, this means

13:51.080 --> 13:53.080
giving our customers the confidence

13:53.080 --> 13:55.080
that everything is functioning smoothly

13:55.080 --> 13:57.080
around the clock

13:57.080 --> 13:59.080
when coding and marking their products.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.080
Providing our customers with the easiest to use

14:02.080 --> 14:05.080
coding and marking systems available today

14:05.080 --> 14:08.080
to always offer our customers

14:08.080 --> 14:10.080
those cost-effective solutions

14:10.080 --> 14:12.080
for all their applications

14:12.080 --> 14:14.080
to help achieve sustainability goals

14:14.080 --> 14:16.080
by providing the smallest

14:16.080 --> 14:18.080
carbon footprint products

14:18.080 --> 14:20.080
along with a peace of mind

14:20.080 --> 14:22.080
and satisfaction

14:22.080 --> 14:24.080
of no longer having to worry

14:24.080 --> 14:26.080
about coding and marking their products.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.080
With the new Leibinger IQJet,

14:28.080 --> 14:31.080
we have succeeded in achieving that.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.080
So, let's take a closer look

14:34.080 --> 14:36.080
at the IQJet.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.080
So, from the exterior you can

14:38.080 --> 14:40.080
can't help but notice

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080
the streamlined, timeless design

14:42.080 --> 14:46.080
with the large 10.1 inch touch display

14:46.080 --> 14:48.080
and the new print head

14:48.080 --> 14:50.080
which now prints more content

14:50.080 --> 14:52.080
with up to 48 dots

14:52.080 --> 14:55.080
and therefore up to 8 lines of code.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.080
But the real assets

14:57.080 --> 15:00.080
and outstanding features

15:00.080 --> 15:03.080
are on the inside of the new IQJet.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.080
And this is where four intelligent

15:05.080 --> 15:07.080
assistance systems

15:07.080 --> 15:09.080
work together to solve

15:09.080 --> 15:11.080
the major challenges

15:11.080 --> 15:13.080
of coding and marking products.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.080
Not only in a way that is different

15:15.080 --> 15:17.080
ladies and gentlemen, but also

15:17.080 --> 15:19.080
much better than all the others.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.080
So, let me briefly introduce

15:21.080 --> 15:23.080
to you these four

15:23.080 --> 15:25.080
very unique systems,

15:25.080 --> 15:27.080
assistance systems.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.080
First, IQ print.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.080
The plug and print

15:31.080 --> 15:33.080
functionality. Responsible

15:33.080 --> 15:35.080
for everything that guarantees

15:35.080 --> 15:37.080
excellent print quality

15:37.080 --> 15:39.080
and the high availability

15:39.080 --> 15:41.080
of the IQJet at all times.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.080
Second, smart OS.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.080
Responsible for the easy operation

15:47.080 --> 15:50.080
and integration of the IQJet

15:50.080 --> 15:52.080
into the production line.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.080
Third, smart efficiency.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.080
Which ensures the lowest operating costs

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
in the industry.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.080
And fourth,

16:03.080 --> 16:05.080
smart care.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.080
Which means that you won't

16:07.080 --> 16:09.080
have to maintain the IQJet

16:09.080 --> 16:11.080
for five years.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.080
Yes, you heard me right.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.080
No maintenance for five years,

16:15.080 --> 16:17.080
but more on that later.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.080
So, I will now take a few minutes

16:20.080 --> 16:22.080
to go into detail about each

16:22.080 --> 16:25.080
of the intelligent assistance systems

16:25.080 --> 16:27.080
so that you can understand

16:27.080 --> 16:30.080
the unique technologies behind them.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.080
So, I will start with IQ print.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.080
As mentioned earlier,

16:35.080 --> 16:37.080
this intelligent assistance

16:37.080 --> 16:39.080
is responsible for

16:39.080 --> 16:42.080
consistently excellent print quality.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.080
The quickest start-up times

16:45.080 --> 16:48.080
and extremely robust printing technology.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.080
IQ print guarantees

16:51.080 --> 16:54.080
maximum productivity in day-to-day operation.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.080
But, how is this possible?

16:56.080 --> 16:58.080
You may ask.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.080
The unique nozzle seal

17:02.080 --> 17:04.080
not only closes the nozzle,

17:04.080 --> 17:06.080
but also the gutter

17:06.080 --> 17:08.080
and the entire ink return,

17:08.080 --> 17:10.080
sealing them completely airtight.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.080
This creates a hydraulic,

17:12.080 --> 17:15.080
odd airtight hydraulic circuit,

17:15.080 --> 17:17.080
which is the prerequisite

17:17.080 --> 17:19.080
for automatic circulation

17:19.080 --> 17:21.080
of the ink through the entire system.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.080
And it ensures that blockages

17:23.080 --> 17:25.080
in the ink circuit or ink drying

17:25.080 --> 17:28.080
are virtually impossible.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.080
For our customers,

17:30.080 --> 17:32.080
this means an exceptionally reliable system

17:32.080 --> 17:35.080
that is available to the maps.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.080
It starts up quickly when it's needed.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.080
There is no ink spitting

17:40.080 --> 17:43.080
as commonly experienced with other systems.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.080
And perhaps best of all,

17:45.080 --> 17:47.080
there is no need to clean

17:47.080 --> 17:49.080
or flush the printhead

17:49.080 --> 17:51.080
of the ink cycle,

17:51.080 --> 17:54.080
as is the case with conventional inkjet printers,

17:54.080 --> 17:57.080
neither at start-up or at shutdown.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.080
But that's not all.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.080
In addition to all these advantages,

18:01.080 --> 18:05.080
the new IQ print is also significantly more robust

18:05.080 --> 18:09.080
and therefore failsafe for many years to come.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.080
The ink circuit closes and opens

18:12.080 --> 18:14.080
40% faster than before,

18:14.080 --> 18:18.080
so the IQ jet is ready to print even more quickly.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.080
This ensures maximum availability

18:21.080 --> 18:24.080
and reliability of the IQ jet

18:24.080 --> 18:26.080
in its day-to-day use.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.080
Of course, the new nozzle sealing technology

18:29.080 --> 18:31.080
and automatic ink circulation

18:31.080 --> 18:35.080
are also a key to consistent print quality.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.080
But IQ jet or IQ print

18:38.080 --> 18:41.080
has even more to offer in this regard.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.080
The new ink temperature control

18:44.080 --> 18:47.080
keeps the ink temperature in the printhead

18:47.080 --> 18:49.080
consistently at the right level.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.080
At the same time,

18:51.080 --> 18:54.080
the viscosity of the ink is precisely controlled,

18:54.080 --> 18:57.080
thanks to a separate ink mixing tank

18:57.080 --> 19:00.080
with a very small control volume

19:00.080 --> 19:03.080
in conjunction with advanced algorithms.

19:03.080 --> 19:06.080
Viscosity control is now much more dynamic,

19:06.080 --> 19:08.080
much faster and more precise

19:08.080 --> 19:11.080
than with any conventional CIJ printer,

19:11.080 --> 19:13.080
where viscosity is usually controlled

19:13.080 --> 19:15.080
in the large reservoir,

19:15.080 --> 19:17.080
control much more sluggish

19:17.080 --> 19:20.080
and slower than with the IQ jet.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.080
With IQ print,

19:22.080 --> 19:25.080
the intelligent ink management system,

19:25.080 --> 19:28.080
you no longer have to worry about print quality.

19:28.080 --> 19:32.080
The IQ jet prints in the very best quality

19:32.080 --> 19:34.080
immediately after start-up.

19:34.080 --> 19:37.080
It continues to do so until the end of production

19:37.080 --> 19:39.080
or even around the clock.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.080
Expensive rejects or complaints are things of the past.

19:43.080 --> 19:47.080
This is what we mean by maximum customer benefit

19:47.080 --> 19:51.080
and it is precisely why we developed IQ print.

19:51.080 --> 19:55.080
So, moving on to the next intelligent

19:55.080 --> 19:59.080
assistance function, SMART OS.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.080
OS stands for Operating System

20:02.080 --> 20:04.080
and this function is responsible

20:04.080 --> 20:08.080
for the simple, intuitive operating system

20:08.080 --> 20:11.080
as well as the easy integration of the IQ jet

20:11.080 --> 20:14.080
into the production environment.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.080
Let's take a closer look.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.080
The new IQ jet is operated

20:19.080 --> 20:24.080
via a large, high-resolution 10.1-inch touch display.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.080
The capacitive touch technology

20:27.080 --> 20:29.080
enables the same operability

20:29.080 --> 20:31.080
you benefit from with a smartphone,

20:31.080 --> 20:35.080
i.e. with easy swiping, dragging, dropping, or zooming.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.080
The display is very responsive,

20:38.080 --> 20:41.080
it is promptly reacting to any finger touch.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.080
When developing the operating concept

20:44.080 --> 20:48.080
we were inspired by state-of-the-art standards

20:48.080 --> 20:52.080
in design thinking and in user-centered design.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.080
It is intuitively simple

20:55.080 --> 20:58.080
and offers quick access to all key functions

20:58.080 --> 21:01.080
and data at all times.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.080
All essential information is clearly displayed

21:04.080 --> 21:06.080
on the home screen

21:06.080 --> 21:08.080
and this means that the operator

21:08.080 --> 21:11.080
normally has no need to change the menu

21:11.080 --> 21:14.080
and can always work in the familiar home screen.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.080
The large, color-coordinated operating elements

21:18.080 --> 21:22.080
make it easy to read the current status of the IQ jet.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.080
The new remote screening

21:24.080 --> 21:27.080
is a case-dependent screensaver

21:27.080 --> 21:30.080
that displays the current status of the IQ jet

21:30.080 --> 21:33.080
and the product counters in full-screen mode

21:33.080 --> 21:36.080
working according to the traffic light principle

21:36.080 --> 21:38.080
like a signal map.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.080
Green indicates that the IQ jet is running,

21:41.080 --> 21:44.080
red the IQ jet has a malfunction

21:44.080 --> 21:47.080
and blue the IQ jet is paused.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.080
This makes it easy to see everything that is important

21:50.080 --> 21:52.080
even from a distance

21:52.080 --> 21:56.080
saving operators a few trips back and forth.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.080
The central menu

21:58.080 --> 22:00.080
in the lower part of the display

22:00.080 --> 22:02.080
with only five icons

22:02.080 --> 22:05.080
is used for general navigation.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.080
From there you can access all main functions

22:08.080 --> 22:11.080
and return to the previous menu at any time.

22:11.080 --> 22:15.080
This makes it easy to find all relevant content

22:15.080 --> 22:18.080
and functions.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.080
The print job editor

22:20.080 --> 22:23.080
has also been improved in great detail.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.080
Numerous design or numerous templates

22:26.080 --> 22:29.080
and design functions are now available.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.080
This allows you to create print jobs

22:32.080 --> 22:34.080
tailored to your specific needs

22:34.080 --> 22:36.080
in no time at all

22:36.080 --> 22:39.080
and to start them simply by the touch of a button.

22:39.080 --> 22:43.080
And if an operating function is not quite clear to you,

22:43.080 --> 22:46.080
Smart OS offers so-called tool tips

22:46.080 --> 22:50.080
or also known as mouseovers or quick info.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.080
So the tool tip appears

22:52.080 --> 22:54.080
when the finger remains motionless

22:54.080 --> 22:57.080
for a short time on the respective element

22:57.080 --> 23:01.080
and provides a brief description of the function.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.080
Our operating philosophy is very simple.

23:04.080 --> 23:08.080
We want anyone to be able to work with our IQJet

23:08.080 --> 23:12.080
without the need for manual or operator training.

23:12.080 --> 23:16.080
So Smart OS ensures even more operating reliability

23:16.080 --> 23:19.080
with myDisplay.

23:19.080 --> 23:23.080
MyDisplay allows you to adapt the operations

23:23.080 --> 23:26.080
specifically to the needs of the respective user

23:26.080 --> 23:28.080
with just a few clicks

23:28.080 --> 23:30.080
all the required settings are made

23:30.080 --> 23:34.080
and the user only sees what he or she really needs

23:34.080 --> 23:37.080
to complete his or her specific tasks

23:37.080 --> 23:40.080
for instance changing the print job.

23:40.080 --> 23:43.080
Everything else is simply hidden.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.080
MyDisplay is a great tool

23:45.080 --> 23:50.080
that helps to virtually eliminate operating errors.

23:50.080 --> 23:54.080
No less important when investing in a coding and marking system

23:54.080 --> 23:57.080
is ease with which it can be integrated

23:57.080 --> 23:59.080
into the production environment.

23:59.080 --> 24:03.080
Here too Smart OS has a lot to offer.

24:03.080 --> 24:06.080
The IQJet features a signal monitor

24:06.080 --> 24:11.080
for the clear display of all input and output signals

24:11.080 --> 24:15.080
as well as a signal simulation function.

24:15.080 --> 24:19.080
So this valuable signal visualization tool

24:19.080 --> 24:21.080
for all input and output

24:21.080 --> 24:24.080
makes it easy to integrate the IQJet

24:24.080 --> 24:25.080
into a production line.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.080
For example signals wired to the inputs

24:28.080 --> 24:29.080
can be visualized

24:29.080 --> 24:31.080
and you can immediately see

24:31.080 --> 24:33.080
whether a signal is present or not.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.080
This means that correct wiring

24:36.080 --> 24:40.080
and signal reliability can be quickly checked.

24:40.080 --> 24:44.080
Moreover output signals can also be temporarily set

24:44.080 --> 24:47.080
by the IQJet to test the external wiring

24:47.080 --> 24:51.080
without the need for a multimeter

24:51.080 --> 24:54.080
or oscilloscope.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.080
The integrated PLC,

24:56.080 --> 24:59.080
the Programmable Logic Controller

24:59.080 --> 25:00.080
is also new.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.080
It enables the convenient linking

25:03.080 --> 25:06.080
of input signals via drag and drop.

25:06.080 --> 25:09.080
All this without requiring any programming knowledge

25:09.080 --> 25:12.080
and without additional external hardware

25:12.080 --> 25:15.080
or extra wiring work.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.080
With the integrated PLC,

25:18.080 --> 25:21.080
printer functions and peripheral devices

25:21.080 --> 25:24.080
can be triggered or controlled individually

25:24.080 --> 25:29.080
depending on input or output signals.

25:29.080 --> 25:34.080
The OPC-UA interface is also available

25:34.080 --> 25:35.080
from now on.

25:35.080 --> 25:39.080
OPC-UA is considered the interface standard

25:39.080 --> 25:41.080
for industry 4.0.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.080
The OPC-UA

25:43.080 --> 25:45.080
detailed process data

25:45.080 --> 25:48.080
from a wide variety of machine control types

25:48.080 --> 25:50.080
can be read, displayed

25:50.080 --> 25:53.080
and analyzed in real time.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.080
Traditional communication barriers

25:55.080 --> 25:57.080
are now in the past.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.080
Today virtually all PLC,

25:59.080 --> 26:02.080
machine and control manufacturers

26:02.080 --> 26:04.080
support this standard.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.080
So connecting new production equipment

26:06.080 --> 26:08.080
no longer takes days

26:08.080 --> 26:13.080
but is usually carried out in less than an hour.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.080
Integrating the printhead

26:15.080 --> 26:17.080
into a production line

26:17.080 --> 26:19.080
is also made easier than ever

26:19.080 --> 26:22.080
thanks to the new bus-based communication

26:22.080 --> 26:24.080
in the IQJET.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.080
The printhead umbilical

26:26.080 --> 26:29.080
is more flexible and adaptable.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.080
This means that even the tightest

26:31.080 --> 26:33.080
installation conditions are no longer a problem

26:33.080 --> 26:35.080
and the printhead can be placed

26:35.080 --> 26:37.080
in optimal position

26:37.080 --> 26:40.080
within the manufacturing process.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.080
So let me summarize all the key features

26:43.080 --> 26:47.080
of the intelligent SMART OS function.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.080
SMART OS makes operating the IQJET

26:50.080 --> 26:54.080
simple, fast and absolutely reliable.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.080
Any possible user operating errors

26:57.080 --> 26:59.080
are reduced to a minimum.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.080
All important functions are clearly organized

27:02.080 --> 27:05.080
and selected without time-consuming navigation

27:05.080 --> 27:07.080
in the operating menu.

27:07.080 --> 27:10.080
The IQJET can be operated by anyone

27:10.080 --> 27:12.080
right from the work-go.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.080
There is no need for user training.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.080
A big advantage is the simple integration

27:17.080 --> 27:21.080
of the IQJET into any production environment.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.080
Many available interfaces

27:23.080 --> 27:25.080
and an integrated PLC

27:25.080 --> 27:27.080
make everything quicker and easier

27:27.080 --> 27:29.080
than ever before.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.080
And when the IQJET is fully connected

27:31.080 --> 27:33.080
you can test everything with the help

27:33.080 --> 27:35.080
of the signal monitor

27:35.080 --> 27:38.080
and the system is ready to go into operation.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.080
Complicated was yesterday

27:40.080 --> 27:44.080
and today is all about ease of use.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.080
And this is exactly what we mean

27:46.080 --> 27:50.080
by unmatched customer benefit.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.080
So let's turn our attention

27:52.080 --> 27:55.080
to the third intelligent assistant.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.080
SMART EFFICIENCY.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.080
SMART EFFICIENCY

28:00.080 --> 28:02.080
ensures that the operating costs

28:02.080 --> 28:03.080
of the IQJET

28:03.080 --> 28:06.080
are reduced to an absolute minimum.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.080
That resources and the environment

28:09.080 --> 28:10.080
are respected

28:10.080 --> 28:12.080
and that the user's well-being

28:12.080 --> 28:14.080
is taken care of.

28:14.080 --> 28:17.080
Let me show you how all this is possible.

28:17.080 --> 28:20.080
With the integrated solvent recovery

28:20.080 --> 28:22.080
evaporated solvent is condensed

28:22.080 --> 28:24.080
from the mixing tank

28:24.080 --> 28:26.080
and the ink return line

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
recovered back into the system.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.080
SMART EFFICIENCY

28:30.080 --> 28:33.080
also includes a one-of-a-kind eco mode.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.080
The additional savings effects

28:35.080 --> 28:37.080
made possible by this unique functionality

28:37.080 --> 28:38.080
of the IQJET

28:38.080 --> 28:40.080
should not be underestimated.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.080
And Leibinger is the only one

28:42.080 --> 28:44.080
who could offer this functionality.

28:44.080 --> 28:48.080
Think of it like the engine start-stop functionality

28:48.080 --> 28:51.080
that is now included on almost all cars.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.080
When the IQJET is not in use

28:54.080 --> 28:57.080
the ink circuit closes automatically

28:57.080 --> 28:59.080
after a predetermined time.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.080
This means that no solvent can evaporate

29:02.080 --> 29:04.080
and escape into the environment.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.080
SMART EFFICIENCY reduces

29:06.080 --> 29:09.080
solvent consumption by up to 50%.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.080
And this of course has a direct

29:11.080 --> 29:13.080
and very positive impact

29:13.080 --> 29:15.080
on operating costs.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.080
Also, significantly less solvent

29:18.080 --> 29:20.080
is released into the environment

29:20.080 --> 29:22.080
for much better working conditions

29:22.080 --> 29:24.080
and the best possible protection

29:24.080 --> 29:27.080
of employee health and well-being.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.080
SMART EFFICIENCY

29:29.080 --> 29:32.080
not only minimizes solvent consumption

29:32.080 --> 29:36.080
but it also saves a considerable amount of energy.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.080
All components of the IQJET

29:38.080 --> 29:42.080
are designed for lowest energy consumption.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.080
The intelligently controlled pump

29:45.080 --> 29:47.080
plays a major role here

29:47.080 --> 29:50.080
as it is only operated intermittently.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.080
Unlike conventional printers

29:53.080 --> 29:55.080
where the pump runs continuously

29:55.080 --> 29:58.080
with the IQJET it only switches on briefly

29:58.080 --> 30:00.080
to fill a pressure tank.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.080
This reduces the energy consumption

30:02.080 --> 30:04.080
of the pump to a minimum

30:04.080 --> 30:08.080
and it also maximizes the durability of the pump.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.080
Thanks to SMART EFFICIENCY

30:11.080 --> 30:15.080
the IQJET consumes only 36 watts on average.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.080
Conventional printers need many times that.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.080
The IQJET boasts the lowest energy consumption

30:22.080 --> 30:24.080
on the market.

30:24.080 --> 30:28.080
Now, moving on to our entirely new cartridge system

30:28.080 --> 30:31.080
and I can rightly say

30:31.080 --> 30:34.080
the best cartridge system in our industry.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.080
Why?

30:36.080 --> 30:38.080
Because no other system is easier,

30:38.080 --> 30:41.080
no other system is quicker to replace

30:41.080 --> 30:45.080
and no other system saves as much anything.

30:45.080 --> 30:50.080
The new XXL cartridges can hold 950 milliliters

30:50.080 --> 30:55.080
which means very large refills of ink and solvent.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.080
If necessary, the quick loading system

30:58.080 --> 31:00.080
allows the cartridges to be inserted

31:00.080 --> 31:02.080
without getting mixed up.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.080
This means that the ink and solvent cartridges

31:04.080 --> 31:08.080
can only fit into the respective refill slot.

31:08.080 --> 31:11.080
The type of consumable is also automatically checked

31:11.080 --> 31:14.080
for consistency before refilling

31:14.080 --> 31:19.080
and the operator is warned of any incorrect filling.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.080
Thanks to the front access

31:21.080 --> 31:24.080
and the special cartridge design

31:24.080 --> 31:27.080
refilling the IQJET is quicker, easier

31:27.080 --> 31:29.080
and more convenient than ever

31:29.080 --> 31:34.080
and of course also during ongoing printing operation.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.080
As mentioned earlier, changing cartridges is very easy

31:38.080 --> 31:41.080
but to make it possible for anyone to do it

31:41.080 --> 31:44.080
without training and interactive assistant

31:44.080 --> 31:48.080
guides the operator through the process step by step.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.080
Another new feature is that the cartridges

31:50.080 --> 31:54.080
can be reordered via the integrated shop system

31:54.080 --> 31:58.080
and added convenience in day-to-day operation.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.080
Once the cartridges have been inserted,

32:00.080 --> 32:03.080
the fluid is immediately emptied

32:03.080 --> 32:06.080
into the internal storage tanks.

32:06.080 --> 32:10.080
This extends the reserve runtimes to up to 50 hours

32:10.080 --> 32:13.080
enough time to order consumables

32:13.080 --> 32:16.080
even after the refill message on the display.

32:16.080 --> 32:21.080
When I say emptied, I mean totally emptied.

32:21.080 --> 32:24.080
Unlike most conventional CIG printers

32:24.080 --> 32:28.080
where considerable amounts of ink remain in the cartridges,

32:28.080 --> 32:33.080
our XXL cartridges empty down to the last drop of ink.

32:33.080 --> 32:37.080
This saves money and the cartridges can simply be disposed of

32:37.080 --> 32:39.080
in the residual waste,

32:39.080 --> 32:44.080
otherwise it becomes expensive hazardous waste.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.080
I'd like to summarize what makes

32:46.080 --> 32:51.080
the smart efficiency intelligence assistance function so unique.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.080
Smart efficiency saves our customers money every day.

32:55.080 --> 33:00.080
The IQJETs operating costs are the lowest in the industry,

33:00.080 --> 33:04.080
up to 50% less solvent consumption,

33:04.080 --> 33:06.080
low energy costs,

33:06.080 --> 33:08.080
and, very importantly,

33:08.080 --> 33:10.080
the environment and the operator are protected

33:10.080 --> 33:13.080
to the greatest possible extent.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.080
Moreover, the new cartridge system

33:15.080 --> 33:19.080
saves a lot of ink due to complete emptying

33:19.080 --> 33:21.080
and the reserve runtimes of consumables

33:21.080 --> 33:24.080
are an incredible 50 hours.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.080
I don't like repeating myself, but I will anyway.

33:27.080 --> 33:32.080
This is what we mean by maximum customer benefit.

33:33.080 --> 33:37.080
We have talked about reducing operating costs to a minimum.

33:37.080 --> 33:42.080
Now I would like to move on to the last of the four intelligent functions.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.080
Thanks to smart care,

33:47.080 --> 33:54.080
the new Leibinger IQJET needs no maintenance for five years.

33:54.080 --> 34:01.080
That means five years printing, printing, printing with no maintenance.

34:01.080 --> 34:06.080
This is achieved thanks to many technical innovations,

34:06.080 --> 34:08.080
such as the new housing

34:08.080 --> 34:12.080
with the increased protection against water and dust as standard,

34:12.080 --> 34:17.080
use of the most durable and high quality components,

34:17.080 --> 34:20.080
the new printhead with its precision parts

34:20.080 --> 34:23.080
manufactured in the Leibinger production facilities

34:23.080 --> 34:26.080
down to micron accuracy,

34:26.080 --> 34:31.080
and the most intelligent hydraulic ink circulation system,

34:31.080 --> 34:37.080
which ensures a much longer service life for the print pump and other components.

34:37.080 --> 34:42.080
In addition, smart care offers the fully automated printhead refresh

34:42.080 --> 34:44.080
at the touch of the button.

34:44.080 --> 34:48.080
It removes ink related contamination from the printhead,

34:48.080 --> 34:51.080
which could occur in extreme customer applications,

34:51.080 --> 34:56.080
and it maintains the printhead in a safe and clean manner.

34:56.080 --> 35:01.080
A fine spray solvent is directed from the gutter

35:01.080 --> 35:04.080
to specific locations in the printhead.

35:04.080 --> 35:09.080
The ink gutter moves up and down to remove any impurities.

35:09.080 --> 35:13.080
Afterwards, a complete automatic drying takes place

35:13.080 --> 35:17.080
and everything is impeccably clean and dry

35:17.080 --> 35:20.080
without requiring any manual intervention

35:20.080 --> 35:24.080
and without the operator coming into contact with cleaning fluid.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.080
That is absolutely unique.

35:27.080 --> 35:32.080
And when it's finally time for maintenance after five years,

35:32.080 --> 35:36.080
customers are free to do it themselves if they wish.

35:36.080 --> 35:41.080
Do it yourself or DIY maintenance is the catch word here.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.080
And if we say this, we actually mean it.

35:45.080 --> 35:49.080
Step by step, the operator is shown on the display

35:49.080 --> 35:51.080
what they have to do.

35:51.080 --> 35:54.080
Even unskilled workers can carry out the maintenance.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.080
No special tools are necessary.

35:57.080 --> 36:02.080
Yes, maintenance can be this easy with the IQJet.

36:02.080 --> 36:07.080
Our customers greatly benefit from zero waiting times

36:07.080 --> 36:10.080
for customer service, better planning,

36:10.080 --> 36:15.080
and ultimately a real plus in production time.

36:15.080 --> 36:19.080
Ladies and gentlemen, these four intelligent functions

36:19.080 --> 36:23.080
make the IQJet the coding and marking system

36:23.080 --> 36:27.080
with the lowest operating costs in the industry.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.080
Let me give you a tangible example.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.080
A manufacturer in the FMCG sector

36:33.080 --> 36:36.080
with 5,000 production hours per year

36:36.080 --> 36:38.080
and 400 prints per minute

36:38.080 --> 36:40.080
with 20-character prints,

36:40.080 --> 36:42.080
a typical application,

36:42.080 --> 36:47.080
saves more than 1,360 euros in the first year alone.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.080
Within eight years,

36:49.080 --> 36:52.080
this adds up to almost 11,000 euros saved

36:52.080 --> 36:55.080
compared to conventional Cij printers.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.080
This makes the IQJet ideally suited

36:58.080 --> 37:01.080
for cost-sensitive applications,

37:01.080 --> 37:03.080
such as in the food and beverage sector

37:03.080 --> 37:06.080
or in the FMCG segment in general.

37:07.080 --> 37:11.080
It is the most versatile, cost-effective,

37:11.080 --> 37:16.080
productive and durable coding and marking system in the world.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.080
Finally, a coding and marking system

37:19.080 --> 37:22.080
that gives customers consistent performance

37:22.080 --> 37:24.080
without any intervention.

37:24.080 --> 37:28.080
You install it and you almost forget.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.080
Plug and print five years,

37:30.080 --> 37:35.080
no maintenance in simply printing, printing, printing.

37:35.080 --> 37:38.080
This is exactly what the four new

37:38.080 --> 37:40.080
intelligent technologies were designed for

37:40.080 --> 37:43.080
and what they guarantee.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.080
Last but certainly not least,

37:46.080 --> 37:48.080
I would like to briefly highlight

37:48.080 --> 37:51.080
Liveanger Connect.

37:51.080 --> 37:56.080
When the IQJet is connected to Liveanger Connect,

37:56.080 --> 37:58.080
everything becomes easier

37:58.080 --> 38:01.080
and, above all, even more efficient.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
With Liveanger Connect,

38:03.080 --> 38:05.080
the user is always well-informed

38:05.080 --> 38:08.080
and has everything important in view,

38:08.080 --> 38:11.080
whether the IQJet's current status,

38:11.080 --> 38:14.080
previews of required actions such as

38:14.080 --> 38:17.080
refill ink, the reach of consumables

38:17.080 --> 38:19.080
or even the production output.

38:19.080 --> 38:23.080
All information is displayed simply and clearly.

38:23.080 --> 38:26.080
This also helps users react at an early stage

38:26.080 --> 38:28.080
so that the production line does not come

38:28.080 --> 38:31.080
to an unwanted standstill in the first place.

38:31.080 --> 38:35.080
If wanted, the user can also be kept up to date

38:35.080 --> 38:37.080
via push message, for example,

38:37.080 --> 38:39.080
in the event of a malfunction.

38:39.080 --> 38:42.080
In addition, historical data helps

38:42.080 --> 38:45.080
identify and leverage any potential

38:45.080 --> 38:47.080
for production optimization.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.080
The modern cloud system is the

38:50.080 --> 38:52.080
high performance platform

38:52.080 --> 38:55.080
for all connected Liveanger printing systems,

38:55.080 --> 38:57.080
regardless of whether they are connected

38:57.080 --> 39:00.080
via LAN or cellular network.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.080
Y, if required,

39:01.080 --> 39:05.080
service partners can also be easily integrated.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.080
They can access the IQJet data remotely

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
and provide targeted support

39:10.080 --> 39:13.080
on all important service issues.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.080
The use of Liveanger Connect

39:16.080 --> 39:20.080
increases the productivity and efficiency

39:20.080 --> 39:23.080
of all connected printers in day to day use

39:23.080 --> 39:26.080
and provides the additional certainty

39:26.080 --> 39:29.080
that everything is under control.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:31.080 --> 39:33.080
I'm at the end of my presentation

39:33.080 --> 39:35.080
and now I hope you enjoy

39:35.080 --> 39:37.080
our new product video.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.080
Thank you very much.

39:53.080 --> 39:57.080
Every great idea begins with a clear starting point.

39:57.080 --> 40:00.080
Here lies the power of change,

40:00.080 --> 40:03.080
of innovation.

40:03.080 --> 40:06.080
A thought begins its journey,

40:06.080 --> 40:09.080
simple and ingenious.

40:09.080 --> 40:15.080
And the unimaginable becomes reality.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.080
Time and time again,

40:17.080 --> 40:19.080
we at Liveanger challenge the conventions

40:19.080 --> 40:21.080
of an entire industry

40:21.080 --> 40:23.080
and create solutions that are simpler,

40:23.080 --> 40:26.080
smarter, more intelligent.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.080
Introducing the new IQJet,

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
the very first intelligent coding

40:31.080 --> 40:33.080
and marketing system worldwide.

40:33.080 --> 40:36.080
Trouble-free printing guaranteed.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.080
No matter what shape,

40:37.080 --> 40:40.080
no matter what surface.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.080
With IQ Print,

40:45.080 --> 40:48.080
the most intelligent ink management.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.080
When not in use,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.080
IQ Print automatically closes

40:51.080 --> 40:52.080
the print nozzle

40:52.080 --> 40:54.080
and lets the ink continue to circulate.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.080
No dry out, no clogging.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.080
Also thanks to Liveanger's

40:58.080 --> 41:00.080
unique print and refresh function

41:00.080 --> 41:01.080
which removes impurities

41:01.080 --> 41:03.080
at the press of a button.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.080
IQ Print ensures instant start-up

41:05.080 --> 41:06.080
every time

41:06.080 --> 41:08.080
and stable, high-quantity printing.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.080
Easy to use with Smart OS,

41:11.080 --> 41:14.080
the IQJet's intuitive operating concept,

41:14.080 --> 41:16.080
individually adjustable

41:16.080 --> 41:19.080
and clearly visible.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.080
Printing has never been this easy

41:21.080 --> 41:23.080
or this cost-effective

41:23.080 --> 41:25.080
because Smart Efficiency

41:25.080 --> 41:27.080
minimizes not only your energy consumption,

41:27.080 --> 41:29.080
it also achieves up to 50%

41:29.080 --> 41:31.080
salt and recovery,

41:31.080 --> 41:33.080
protecting your health and the environment

41:33.080 --> 41:36.080
and saving money.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.080
Just like the XXL cartridges,

41:39.080 --> 41:40.080
they are quickly replaced

41:40.080 --> 41:43.080
and emptied down to the last drop.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.080
And finally,

41:44.080 --> 41:47.080
we're introducing Smart Care,

41:47.080 --> 41:51.080
printing 5 years without maintenance.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.080
The new IQJet.

41:54.080 --> 41:59.080
Intelligence on point.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.080
Good afternoon everybody.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.080
My name is Christophe Lopez.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.080
I joined Liveanger

42:12.080 --> 42:14.080
as Chief Commercial Officer

42:14.080 --> 42:16.080
at the beginning of March.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.080
I'm really happy to be here today

42:18.080 --> 42:20.080
to be able to meet you

42:20.080 --> 42:23.080
our customers and our partners.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.080
I've made many appointments

42:25.080 --> 42:26.080
with many of you,

42:26.080 --> 42:28.080
but if this is not the case,

42:28.080 --> 42:30.080
don't hesitate to reach out to me.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.080
If you want to talk,

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
I'll be more than happy to share

42:33.080 --> 42:35.080
and spend time with you.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.080
I've been in the marketing and coding industry

42:37.080 --> 42:39.080
for nearly 15 years,

42:39.080 --> 42:42.080
including 12 years with Marketing Match,

42:42.080 --> 42:45.080
where I held a multiple executive position

42:45.080 --> 42:47.080
in sales and marketing,

42:47.080 --> 42:49.080
as well as general management

42:49.080 --> 42:52.080
of the main site in France.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.080
Before that,

42:53.080 --> 42:55.080
I was already in the industry

42:55.080 --> 42:57.080
working for Everyday Nissan

42:57.080 --> 42:59.080
and Honeywell.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.080
I decided to join Liveanger

43:01.080 --> 43:04.080
because it is structurally different

43:04.080 --> 43:06.080
from the rest of the competitors,

43:06.080 --> 43:09.080
being a private company

43:09.080 --> 43:11.080
with strong values

43:11.080 --> 43:14.080
and a great innovative mindset.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.080
I really see great potential

43:16.080 --> 43:18.080
for development in the coming years.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.080
I can also tell you

43:20.080 --> 43:22.080
that being part of the company now,

43:22.080 --> 43:24.080
I'm even more impressed

43:24.080 --> 43:26.080
about the people, the technology

43:26.080 --> 43:28.080
and the mindset.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.080
I'm particularly impressed

43:30.080 --> 43:32.080
by how Liveanger

43:32.080 --> 43:35.080
is changing the game in CIG.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.080
CIG is a great technology

43:37.080 --> 43:40.080
when it was invented 40 years ago.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.080
It rechained the game

43:42.080 --> 43:45.080
at the time in the marketing and coding industry

43:45.080 --> 43:49.080
by allowing the printing of valuable data

43:49.080 --> 43:51.080
on a large variety of substrates

43:51.080 --> 43:53.080
at high production speeds.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.080
That was a revolution

43:55.080 --> 43:57.080
to guarantee the trustability

43:57.080 --> 43:59.080
and the freshness of products.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.080
The issue of CIG

44:01.080 --> 44:03.080
from the start

44:03.080 --> 44:05.080
was that it was a complex

44:05.080 --> 44:08.080
and not very reliable technology.

44:08.080 --> 44:11.080
Printers would eventually not start

44:11.080 --> 44:13.080
or would stop unexpectedly

44:13.080 --> 44:16.080
o would spilling on the floor

44:16.080 --> 44:18.080
and quality of prints

44:18.080 --> 44:20.080
would vary over time.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.080
It would also be quite costly to operate

44:23.080 --> 44:25.080
using large quantities of fluid

44:25.080 --> 44:28.080
and a lot of spare parts.

44:28.080 --> 44:31.080
The main CIG manufacturers

44:31.080 --> 44:33.080
tried to solve these problems

44:33.080 --> 44:36.080
by implementing incremental enhancement

44:36.080 --> 44:38.080
to reduce these issues

44:38.080 --> 44:40.080
but none of them really addressed

44:40.080 --> 44:42.080
the problem at the core

44:42.080 --> 44:45.080
and instead they deployed armies of technicians

44:45.080 --> 44:49.080
to maintain and repair the machines.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.080
But this is history now

44:51.080 --> 44:54.080
with the launch of IQChat.

44:54.080 --> 44:57.080
How would you, customers and partners

44:57.080 --> 44:59.080
define the ultimate

44:59.080 --> 45:03.080
marking and coding machine?

45:03.080 --> 45:06.080
I believe whether you are a production manager,

45:06.080 --> 45:09.080
a quality manager, maintenance manager,

45:09.080 --> 45:11.080
even a finance manager

45:11.080 --> 45:14.080
what you want is one single thing.

45:14.080 --> 45:17.080
You want a printer that you install easily

45:17.080 --> 45:19.080
and then that will print seamlessly

45:19.080 --> 45:23.080
as needed without having to intervene.

45:23.080 --> 45:28.080
You install it and you almost forget it.

45:28.080 --> 45:32.080
Productivity and low operating cost.

45:32.080 --> 45:36.080
Albert Einstein said the definition of genius

45:36.080 --> 45:38.080
is taking the complex

45:38.080 --> 45:40.080
and making it simple.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.080
IQChat is the first printer

45:42.080 --> 45:44.080
that is really changing the game

45:44.080 --> 45:46.080
since the invention of CIG

45:46.080 --> 45:48.080
based on two unique features

45:48.080 --> 45:50.080
which are simple to understand

45:50.080 --> 45:55.080
and yet extremely complex to implement.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.080
The number one concept

45:57.080 --> 45:59.080
is that the head is sealed.

45:59.080 --> 46:03.080
Let me take an image.

46:03.080 --> 46:08.080
Look at that kind of paint.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.080
If it's sealed,

46:10.080 --> 46:13.080
it can stay perfect for many years

46:13.080 --> 46:17.080
but just open the trap

46:17.080 --> 46:20.080
and it will dry in only a few hours.

46:20.080 --> 46:22.080
With live in your IQChat,

46:22.080 --> 46:24.080
the ink will never dry

46:24.080 --> 46:27.080
and the viscosity will stay stable

46:27.080 --> 46:33.080
allowing perfect operation in all conditions.

46:33.080 --> 46:37.080
I would like to take a second image.

46:37.080 --> 46:40.080
This is what I call the balloon concept.

46:40.080 --> 46:44.080
The way the in-circuit works in IQChat

46:44.080 --> 46:47.080
is that you inflate once

46:47.080 --> 46:50.080
and then you just need to bring a small quantity of air

46:50.080 --> 46:53.080
to keep it inflated over time.

46:53.080 --> 46:56.080
That means that the entire system

46:56.080 --> 46:59.080
is working only a small fraction of the time

46:59.080 --> 47:03.080
and why the reliability of IQChat is unmatched.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.080
The competitor's machine,

47:05.080 --> 47:07.080
even the most recent ones,

47:07.080 --> 47:09.080
are continuously pumping

47:09.080 --> 47:12.080
to maintain pressure in the in-circuit

47:12.080 --> 47:14.080
and therefore their printers

47:14.080 --> 47:17.080
are going to fail early.

47:17.080 --> 47:20.080
Whatever they say or whatever they do.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.080
With these two principles,

47:22.080 --> 47:24.080
the IQChat printer redefines

47:24.080 --> 47:27.080
the market standards for reliability

47:27.080 --> 47:30.080
and autonomy in marking and coding.

47:30.080 --> 47:33.080
Its unique disruptive design

47:33.080 --> 47:36.080
will transform the industry's experience

47:36.080 --> 47:39.080
working with CIG.

47:39.080 --> 47:41.080
100% clean,

47:41.080 --> 47:44.080
seamless start and stops,

47:44.080 --> 47:47.080
5-year operation

47:47.080 --> 47:49.080
without schedule maintenance

47:49.080 --> 47:52.080
and un parallel cost of a machine.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.080
Plug and print,

47:54.080 --> 47:57.080
the ultimate printing machine.

47:57.080 --> 48:00.080
This is the CIG we invented.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.080
And now I would like to introduce

48:02.080 --> 48:04.080
Christophe Orish,

48:04.080 --> 48:06.080
our director of sales EMEA

48:06.080 --> 48:08.080
and HAPAC,

48:08.080 --> 48:11.080
that will tell you how we plan to work together with you

48:11.080 --> 48:13.080
to turn this great innovation

48:13.080 --> 48:16.080
into a huge commercial success.

48:16.080 --> 48:19.080
Thank you very much.

48:19.080 --> 48:22.080
Gracias, Christophe.

48:22.080 --> 48:25.080
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.080
Now that you have seen the smartest coding

48:28.080 --> 48:30.080
and marking system in the industry,

48:30.080 --> 48:33.080
please give me the chance to talk to you

48:33.080 --> 48:36.080
about the go-to-market strategy for this product

48:36.080 --> 48:38.080
and some relevant tools

48:38.080 --> 48:41.080
that will help you expand your business success

48:41.080 --> 48:44.080
together with the Lighting On.

48:44.080 --> 48:47.080
For us, the introduction of the completely new platform

48:47.080 --> 48:50.080
represents an important milestone,

48:50.080 --> 48:53.080
a massive technological step

48:53.080 --> 48:56.080
with strategic importance.

48:56.080 --> 48:58.080
And to this extent,

48:58.080 --> 49:01.080
we would like you to benefit from the IQChat

49:01.080 --> 49:04.080
as a partner and customer.

49:04.080 --> 49:06.080
With the IQChat,

49:06.080 --> 49:08.080
we will, on the one hand,

49:08.080 --> 49:11.080
address existing, convinced customers,

49:11.080 --> 49:14.080
as well as penetrate new markets

49:14.080 --> 49:18.080
to sustainably grow our market share.

49:18.080 --> 49:21.080
With its competitive price point

49:21.080 --> 49:25.080
and in combination with the exceptionally low operating cost,

49:25.080 --> 49:28.080
the IQChat is the ideal coding marking system

49:28.080 --> 49:31.080
for a very broad range of applications

49:31.080 --> 49:36.080
in virtually all segments of modern manufacturing.

49:36.080 --> 49:38.080
With this in mind,

49:38.080 --> 49:40.080
we would be working with you

49:40.080 --> 49:42.080
to target new customer segments

49:42.080 --> 49:45.080
and communicate the IQChat benefit message

49:45.080 --> 49:48.080
with high-level impact.

49:48.080 --> 49:51.080
We have started worldwide marketing activities

49:51.080 --> 49:53.080
as of immediately,

49:53.080 --> 49:55.080
and we are supporting this process

49:55.080 --> 49:58.080
by professional communication measures.

49:58.080 --> 50:01.080
This means stepping up social media communication

50:01.080 --> 50:03.080
and newsletters,

50:03.080 --> 50:06.080
participating in trade fairs around the globe,

50:06.080 --> 50:09.080
international PR work,

50:09.080 --> 50:12.080
benefit-focused campaigns and promotions,

50:12.080 --> 50:15.080
a key account customer roadshow,

50:15.080 --> 50:17.080
and, last but not least,

50:17.080 --> 50:23.080
we will be going after our potential customers directly.

50:23.080 --> 50:26.080
We also have attractive point-of-sale packages

50:26.080 --> 50:28.080
ready for you,

50:28.080 --> 50:30.080
as well as in brochures, data sheets,

50:30.080 --> 50:32.080
and website content, of course,

50:32.080 --> 50:36.080
which you can easily integrate into your website.

50:36.080 --> 50:40.080
So, everything you need to successfully introduce

50:40.080 --> 50:43.080
the IQChat is now available.

50:43.080 --> 50:48.080
Of course, we are relying on you, our partners.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.080
Because only together with you

50:50.080 --> 50:52.080
will we be able to drive the marketing

50:52.080 --> 50:54.080
of the IQChat forward,

50:54.080 --> 50:57.080
and we will be supporting you wherever necessary

50:57.080 --> 51:02.080
so that we can achieve these goals together.

51:02.080 --> 51:05.080
We will begin training your sales teams immediately

51:05.080 --> 51:08.080
so that they can effectively communicate

51:08.080 --> 51:11.080
the many benefits of the IQChat.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.080
We will also train your service staff

51:13.080 --> 51:15.080
to ensure that the installation

51:15.080 --> 51:17.080
and predictive maintenance of the IQChat

51:17.080 --> 51:20.080
runs smoothly.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.080
We will be letting you know today

51:22.080 --> 51:26.080
when the training sessions will be held.

51:26.080 --> 51:28.080
Right after this event,

51:28.080 --> 51:31.080
you will also find out the exact price positioning

51:31.080 --> 51:33.080
of the IQChat.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.080
At the same time,

51:35.080 --> 51:37.080
the price point is extremely attractive,

51:37.080 --> 51:39.080
and when you consider the fact

51:39.080 --> 51:41.080
that the IQChat has the lowest operating costs

51:41.080 --> 51:43.080
in the industry

51:43.080 --> 51:45.080
and includes many useful functions,

51:45.080 --> 51:49.080
the package really is unbeatable.

51:49.080 --> 51:52.080
Overall, a completely new benchmark

51:52.080 --> 51:56.080
for total cost of ownership.

51:56.080 --> 51:58.080
So, let me now briefly explain

51:58.080 --> 52:01.080
what's next on today's agenda.

52:01.080 --> 52:03.080
Following the presentation,

52:03.080 --> 52:05.080
our complete team will be available

52:05.080 --> 52:09.080
to answer any questions you may still have.

52:09.080 --> 52:11.080
Of course, you will also have an opportunity

52:11.080 --> 52:13.080
to experience the new IQChat,

52:13.080 --> 52:15.080
the new marketing materials,

52:15.080 --> 52:18.080
and much more life.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.080
We have set up a small marketplace

52:20.080 --> 52:24.080
in this room and in the adjoining room.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.080
The various market stations

52:26.080 --> 52:28.080
cover different relevant subjects

52:28.080 --> 52:31.080
of the market launch of the IQChat.

52:31.080 --> 52:34.080
You will receive more technical information,

52:34.080 --> 52:36.080
general product information,

52:36.080 --> 52:38.080
as well as marketing information.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.080
A detailed marketplace guide,

52:40.080 --> 52:42.080
including a map,

52:42.080 --> 52:44.080
showing the different stations

52:44.080 --> 52:46.080
is available at both sides

52:46.080 --> 52:49.080
exit of this room.

52:49.080 --> 52:51.080
So, everything that is required

52:51.080 --> 52:53.080
for a successful launch.

52:53.080 --> 52:55.080
Of course, you can also try out

52:55.080 --> 52:57.080
the IQChat yourself

52:57.080 --> 53:00.080
and familiarize with it.

53:00.080 --> 53:02.080
Some refreshments and finger food

53:02.080 --> 53:04.080
will be available for you there

53:04.080 --> 53:06.080
and we will start serving those

53:06.080 --> 53:09.080
in a couple of minutes.

53:09.080 --> 53:11.080
In the further course,

53:11.080 --> 53:13.080
we will have the main course buffet

53:13.080 --> 53:15.080
set up around 4.30 pm

53:15.080 --> 53:17.080
and we should not miss

53:17.080 --> 53:20.080
the additional surprise afterwards.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.080
So, we really look forward

53:22.080 --> 53:24.080
to spending a few more hours

53:24.080 --> 53:26.080
to celebrate this important milestone

53:26.080 --> 53:29.080
and with food, drinks, music

53:29.080 --> 53:32.080
and lively conversations.

53:32.080 --> 53:34.080
We are very much looking forward

53:34.080 --> 53:36.080
to sharing ideas with you

53:36.080 --> 53:38.080
at our marketplace on the product,

53:38.080 --> 53:40.080
the business and beyond.

53:40.080 --> 53:42.080
So, finally, thank you very much

53:42.080 --> 53:44.080
for your attention.
